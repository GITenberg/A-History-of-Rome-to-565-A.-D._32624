<head>PREFACE</head>

<p>
This sketch of the History of Rome to 565 <hi rend='small'>A. D.</hi> is primarily
intended to meet the needs of introductory college courses in Roman
History. However, it is hoped that it may also prove of service as
a handbook for students of Roman life and literature in general. It
is with the latter in mind that I have added the bibliographical note.
Naturally, within the brief limits of such a text, it was impossible
to defend the point of view adopted on disputed points or to take
notice of divergent opinions. Therefore, to show the great debt which
I owe to the work of others, and to provide those interested in
particular problems with some guide to more detailed study, I have
given a list of selected references, which express, I believe, the prevailing
views of modern scholarship upon the various phases of
Roman History.
</p>

<p>
I wish to acknowledge my general indebtedness to Professor W. S.
Ferguson of Harvard University for his guidance in my approach
to the study of Roman History, and also my particular obligations
to Professor W. L. Westermann of Cornell, and to my colleagues,
Professors A. L. Cross and J. G. Winter, for reading portions of
my manuscript and for much helpful criticism.
</p>

<head type="sub"><hi rend='smallcaps'>The Sources for the Study of Early Roman History</hi></head>

<p>
The student beginning the study of Roman History through the
medium of the works of modern writers cannot fail to note wide
differences in the treatment accorded by them to the early centuries
of the life of the Roman State. These differences are mainly due
to differences of opinion among moderns as to the credibility of the
ancient accounts of this period. And so it will perhaps prove helpful
to give a brief review of these sources, and to indicate the estimate
of their value which is reflected in this book.
</p>

<p>
The earliest Roman historical records were in the form of annals,
that is, brief notices of important events in connection with the
names of the consuls or other eponymous officials for each year.
They may be compared to the early monastic chronicles of the
Middle Ages. Writing was practised in Rome as early as the sixth
century <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> and there can be no doubt that the names of consuls
or their substitutes were recorded from the early years of the republic,
although the form of the record is unknown. It is in the annals
that the oldest list of the consuls was preserved, the Capitoline consular
and triumphal Fasti or lists being reconstructions of the time
of Augustus.
</p>

<p>
The authorship of the earliest annals is not recorded. However,
at the opening of the second century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the Roman pontiffs had
in their custody annals which purported to run back to the foundation
of the city, including the regal period. We know also that as late
as the time of the Gracchi it was customary for the Pontifex Maximus
to record on a tablet for public inspection the chief events of each
year. When this custom began is uncertain and it can only be
proven for the time when the Romans had commenced to undertake
maritime wars. From these pontifical records were compiled the
so-<pb n='xiv'/><anchor id='Pgxiv'/>called <hi rend='italic'>annales Maximi</hi>, or chief annals, whose name permits the
belief that briefer compilations were also in existence. There were
likewise commentaries preserved in the priestly colleges, which contained
ritualistic formulæ, as well as attempted explanations of the
origins of usages and ceremonies.
</p>

<p>
Apart from these annals and commentaries there existed but little
historical material before the close of the third century <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> There
was no Roman literature; no trace remains of any narrative poetry,
nor of family chronicles. Brief funerary inscriptions, like that of
Scipio Barbatus, appear in the course of the third century, and
laudatory funeral orations giving the records of family achievements
seem to have come into vogue about the end of the same century.
</p>

<p>
However, the knowledge of writing made possible the inscription
upon stone or other material of public documents which required to
be preserved with exactness. Thus laws and treaties were committed
to writing. But the Romans, unlike the Greeks, paid little attention
to the careful preservation of other documents and, until a late date,
did not even keep a record of the minor magistrates. Votive offerings
and other dedications were also inscribed, but as with the laws and
treaties, few of these survived into the days of historical writing,
owing to neglect and the destruction wrought in the city by the
Gauls in 387 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
Nor had the Greeks paid much attention to Roman history prior
to the war with Pyrrhus in 281 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>, although from that time
onwards Greek historians devoted themselves to the study of Roman
affairs. From this date the course of Roman history is fairly clear.
However, as early as the opening of the fourth century <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> the
Greeks had sought to bring the Romans into relation with other
civilized peoples of the ancient world by ascribing the foundation of
Rome to Aeneas and the exiles from Troy; a tale which had gained
acceptance in Rome by the close of the third century.
</p>

<p>
The first step in Roman historical writing was taken at the close
of the Second Punic War by Quintus Fabius Pictor, who wrote in
Greek a history of Rome from its foundation to his own times. A
similar work, also in Greek, was composed by his contemporary,
Lucius Cincius Alimentus. The oldest traditions were thus wrought
into a connected version, which has been preserved in some passages
of Polybius, but to a larger extent in the fragments of the <hi rend='italic'>Library of
Universal History</hi> compiled by Diodorus the Sicilian about 30 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>
<pb n='xv'/><anchor id='Pgxv'/>Existing portions of his work (books 11 to 20) cover the period
from 480 to 302 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>; and as his library is little more than a series
of excerpts his selections dealing with Roman history reflect his
sources with little contamination.
</p>

<p>
Other Roman chroniclers of the second century <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> also wrote in
Greek and, although early in that century Ennius wrote his epic
relating the story of Rome from the settlement of Aeneas, it was
not until about 168 that the first historical work in Latin prose
appeared. This was the <hi rend='italic'>Origins</hi> of Marcus Porcius Cato, which
contained an account of the mythical origins of Rome and other
Italian cities, and was subsequently expanded to cover the period
from the opening of the Punic Wars to 149 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
Contemporary history soon attracted the attention of the Romans
but they did not neglect the earlier period. In their treatment of
the latter new tendencies appear about the time of Sulla under
patriotic and rhetorical stimuli. The aim of historians now became
to provide the public with an account of the early days of Rome that
would be commeasurate with her later greatness, and to adorn this
narrative, in Greek fashion, with anecdotes, speeches, and detailed
descriptions, which would enliven their pages and fascinate their
readers. Their material they obtained by invention, by falsification,
and by the incorporation into Roman history of incidents from the
history of other peoples. These writers were not strictly historians,
but writers of historical romance. Their chief representative was
Valerius Antias.
</p>

<p>
The Ciceronian age saw great vigor displayed in antiquarian research,
with the object of explaining the origin of ancient Roman
customs, ceremonies, institutions, monuments, and legal formulæ, and
of establishing early Roman chronology. In this field the greatest
activity was shown by Marcus Terentius Varro, whose <hi rend='italic'>Antiquities</hi>
deeply influenced his contemporaries and successors.
</p>

<p>
In the age of Augustus, between 27 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> and 19 <hi rend='small'>A. D.</hi>, Livy wrote
his great history of Rome from its beginnings. His work summed
up the efforts of his predecessors and gave to the history of Rome
down to his own times the form which it preserved for the rest of
antiquity. Although it is lacking in critical acumen in the handling
of sources, and in an understanding for political and military history,
the dramatic and literary qualities of his work have ensured its
popularity. Of it there have been preserved the first ten books (to
<pb n='xvi'/><anchor id='Pgxvi'/>293 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>), and books 21 to 45 (from 218 to 167 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>). A contemporary
of Livy was the Greek writer Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
who wrote a work called <hi rend='italic'>Roman Antiquities</hi>, which covered the history
of Rome down to 265 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> The earlier part of his work has
also been preserved. In general he depended upon Varro and Livy,
and gives substantially the same view of early Roman history as
the latter.
</p>

<p>
What these later writers added to the meagre annalistic narrative
preserved in Diodorus is of little historical value, except in so far
as it shows what the Romans came to believe with regard to their
own past. The problem which faced the later Roman historians
was the one which faces writers of Roman history today, namely,
to explain the origins and early development of the Roman state.
And their explanation does not deserve more credence than a modern
reconstruction simply because they were nearer in point of time to
the period in question, for they had no wealth of historical materials
which have since been lost, and they were not animated by a desire
to reach the truth at all costs nor guided by rational principles of
historical criticism. Accordingly we must regard as mythical the
traditional narrative of the founding of Rome and of the regal period,
and for the history of the republic to the time of the war with
Pyrrhus we should rely upon the list of eponymous magistrates,
whose variations indicate political crises, supplemented by the account
in Diodorus, with the admission that this itself is not infallible. All
that supplements or deviates from this we should frankly acknowledge
to be of a hypothetical nature. Therefore we should concede
the impossibility of giving a complete and adequate account of
the history of these centuries and refrain from doing ourselves what
we criticize in the Roman historians.

<head>THE GEOGRAPHY OF ITALY</head>

<p>
Italy, ribbed by the Apennines, girdled by the Alps and the sea,
juts out like a <q>long pier-head</q> from Europe towards the northern
coast of Africa. It includes two regions of widely differing physical
characteristics: the northern, continental; the southern, peninsular.
The peninsula is slightly larger than the continental portion: together
their area is about 91,200 square miles.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Continental Italy.</hi> The continental portion of Italy consists of
the southern watershed of the Alps and the northern watershed of
the Apennines, with the intervening lowland plain, drained, for the
most part, by the river Po and its numerous tributaries. On the
north, the Alps extend in an irregular crescent of over 1200 miles
from the Mediterranean to the Adriatic. They rise abruptly on
the Italian side, but their northern slope is gradual, with easy passes
leading over the divide to the southern plain. Thus they invite
rather than deter immigration from central Europe. East and west
continental Italy measures around 320 miles; its width from north
to south does not exceed seventy miles.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The peninsula.</hi> The southern portion of Italy consists of a long,
narrow peninsula, running northwest and southeast between the
Mediterranean and Adriatic seas, and terminating in two promontories,
which form the toe and heel of the <q>Italian boot.</q> The length
of the peninsula is 650 miles; its breadth is nowhere more than 125
miles. In striking contrast to the plains of the Po, southern Italy
is traversed throughout by the parallel ridges of the Apennines,
which give it an endless diversity of hill and valley. The average
height of these mountains, which form a sort of vertebrate system
for the peninsula (<hi rend="italic">Apennino dorso Italia dividitur</hi>, Livy xxxvi, 15),
is about 4,000 feet, and even their highest peaks (9,500 feet) are
<pb n="4"/><anchor id="Pg4"/>below the line of perpetual snow. The Apennine chain is highest
on its eastern side where it approaches closely to the Adriatic, leaving
only a narrow strip of coast land, intersected by numerous short
mountain torrents. On the west the mountains are lower and recede
further from the sea, leaving the wide lowland areas of Etruria,
Latium and Campania. On this side, too, are rivers of considerable
length, navigable for small craft; the Volturnus and Liris, the Tiber
and the Arno, whose valleys link the coast with the highlands of
the interior.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The <anchor id="corr004"/><corr sic="Coast-line">coast-line</corr>.</hi> In comparison with Greece, Italy presents a
striking regularity of coast-line. Throughout its length of over
2000 miles it has remarkably few deep bays or good harbors, and
these few are almost all on the southern and western shores. Thus
the character of the Mediterranean coast of Italy, with its fertile
lowlands, its rivers, its harbors, and its general southerly aspect,
rendered it more inviting and accessible to approach from the sea
than the eastern coast, and determined its leadership in the cultural
and material advancement of the peninsula.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Climate.</hi> The climate of Italy as a whole, like that of other
Mediterranean lands, is characterized by a high average temperature,
and an absence of extremes of heat or cold. Nevertheless, it varies
greatly in different localities, according to their northern or southern
situation, their elevation, and their proximity to the sea. In the
Po valley there is a close approach to the continental climate of
central Europe, with a marked difference between summer and winter
temperatures and clearly marked transitional periods of spring and
autumn. On the other hand, in the south of the peninsula the
climate becomes more tropical, with its periods of winter rain and
summer drought, and a rapid transition between the moist and the
dry seasons.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Malaria.</hi> Both in antiquity and in modern times the disease
from which Italy has suffered most has been the dreaded malaria.
The explanation is to be found in the presence of extensive marshy
areas in the river valleys and along the coast. The ravages of this
disease have varied according as the progress of civilization has
brought about the cultivation and drainage of the affected areas or
its decline has wrought the undoing of this beneficial work.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Forests.</hi> In striking contrast to their present baldness, the slopes
of the Apennines were once heavily wooded, and the well-tilled
<pb n="5"/><anchor id="Pg5"/>fields of the Po valley were also covered with tall forests. Timber
for houses and ships was to be had in abundance, and as late as the
time of Augustus Italy was held to be a well-forested country.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Minerals.</hi> The mineral wealth of Italy has never been very great
at any time. In antiquity the most important deposits were the iron
ores of the island of Elba, and the copper mines of Etruria and
Liguria. For a time, the gold washings in the valleys of the Graian
Alps were worked with profit.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Agriculture.</hi> The true wealth of Italy lay in the richness of her
soil, which generously repaid the labor of agriculturist or horticulturist.
The lowland areas yielded large crops of grain of all sorts—millet,
maize, wheat, oats and barley—while legumes were raised in
abundance everywhere. Campania was especially fertile and is reported
to have yielded three successive crops annually. The vine
and the olive flourished, and their cultivation eventually became even
more profitable than the raising of grain.
</p>

<p>
The valleys and mountain sides afforded excellent pasturage at
all seasons, and the raising of cattle and sheep ranked next in importance
to agricultural pursuits among the country’s industries.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The <anchor id="corr005"/><corr sic="Islands">islands</corr>: Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica.</hi> The geographical location
of the three large islands, Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, links
their history closely with that of the Italian peninsula. The large
triangle of Sicily (11,290 sq. mi.) is separated from the southwest
extremity of Italy by the narrow straits of Rhegium, and lies like
a stepping-stone between Europe and Africa. Its situation, and
the richness of its soil, which caused it to become one of the granaries
of Rome, made it of far greater historical importance than the other
two islands. Sardinia (9,400 sq. mi.) and Corsica (3,376 sq. mi.),
owing to their rugged, mountainous character and their greater remoteness
from the coast of Italy, have been always, from both the
economic and the cultural standpoint, far behind the more favored
Sicily.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The historical significance of Italy’s configuration and location.</hi>
The configuration of the Italian peninsula, long, narrow, and
traversed by mountain ridges, hindered rather than helped its political
unification. Yet the Apennine chain, running parallel to the length
of the peninsula, offered no such serious barriers to that unification
as did the network of mountains and the long inlets that intersect
the peninsula of Greece. And when once Italy had been welded
<pb n="6"/><anchor id="Pg6"/>into a single state by the power of Rome, its central position greatly
facilitated the extension of the Roman dominion over the whole
Mediterranean basin.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The name Italia.</hi> The name Italy is the ancient <hi rend="italic">Italia</hi>, derived
from the people known as the <hi rend="italic">Itali</hi>, whose name had its origin in the
word <hi rend="italic">vitulus</hi> (calf). It was applied by the Greeks as early as the
fifth century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> to the southwestern extremity of the peninsula,
adjacent to the island of Sicily. It rapidly acquired a much wider
significance, until, from the opening of the second century, <hi rend="italic">Italia</hi> in
a geographical sense denoted the whole country as far north as the
Alps. Politically, as we shall see, the name for a long time had a
much more restricted significance.
</p>

<index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="II. Prehistoric Civilization in Italy"/>
<head type="sub">CHAPTER II</head>

<head>PREHISTORIC CIVILIZATION IN ITALY</head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Accessibility of Italy to external influences.</hi> The long coast-line
of the Italian peninsula rendered it peculiarly accessible to influences
from overseas, for the sea united rather than divided the
peoples of antiquity. Thus Italy was constantly subjected to immigration
by sea, and much more so to cultural stimuli from the lands
whose shores bordered the same seas as her own. Nor did the Alps
and the forests and swamps of the Po valley oppose any effectual
barrier to migrations and cultural influences from central Europe.
Consequently we have in Italy the meeting ground of peoples coming
by sea from east and south and coming over land from the north,
each bringing a new racial, linguistic, and cultural element to enrich
the life of the peninsula. These movements had been going on since
remote antiquity, until, at the beginning of the period of recorded
history, Italy was occupied by peoples of different races, speaking
different languages, and living under widely different political and
cultural conditions.
</p>

<p>
As yet many problems connected with the origin and migrations
of the historic peoples of Italy remain unsolved; but the sciences of
archaeology and philology have done much toward enabling us to
present a reasonably clear and connected picture of the development
of civilization and the movements of these peoples in prehistoric
times.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Old Stone Age.</hi> From all over Italy come proofs of the
presence of man in the earliest stage of human development—the
Paleolithic or Old Stone Age. The chipped flint instruments of this
epoch have been found in considerable abundance, and are chiefly of
the Moustérien and Chelléen types. With these have been unearthed
the bones of the cave bear, cave lion, cave hyena, giant stag, and
early types of the rhinoceros, hippopotamus, and elephant, which
Paleolithic man fought and hunted. In the Balzi Rossi caves, near
Ventimiglia in Liguria, there have been found human skeletons, some
of which, at least, are agreed to be of the Paleolithic Age. But the
<pb n="8"/><anchor id="Pg8"/>caves in Liguria and elsewhere, then the only habitations which men
knew, do not reveal the lifelike and vigorous mural drawings and
carvings on bone, which the Old Stone Age has left in the caves of
France and Spain.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The New Stone Age.</hi> With the Neolithic or New Stone Age
there appears in Italy a civilization characterized by the use of instruments
of polished stone. Axes, adzes, and chisels, of various
shapes and sizes, as well as other utensils, were shaped by polishing
and grinding from sandstone, limestone, jade, nephrite, diorite, and
other stones. Along with these, however, articles of chipped flint
and obsidian, for which the workshops have been found, and also
instruments of bone, were in common use. The Neolithic people
were also acquainted with the art of making pottery, an art unknown
to the Paleolithic Age.
</p>

<p>
Like the men of the preceding epoch, those of the Neolithic Age
readily took up their abode in natural caves. However, they also
built for themselves villages of circular huts of wicker-work and
clay, at times erected over pits excavated in the ground. Such village
sites, the so-called <hi rend="italic">fonde di capanne</hi>, are widely distributed
throughout Italy.
</p>

<p>
They buried their dead in caves, or in pits dug in the ground,
sometimes lining the pit with stones. The corpse was regularly
placed in a contracted position, accompanied by weapons, vases, clothing,
and food. Second burials and the practice of coloring the bones
of the skeletons with red pigment were in vogue.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Climatic change.</hi> The climate of Italy had changed considerably
from that of the preceding age, and a new fauna had appeared. In
place of the primitive elephant and his associates, Neolithic men
hunted the stag, beaver, bear, fox, wolf and wild boar. Remains
of such domestic animals as the ox, horse, sheep, goat, pig, dog,
and ass, show that they were a pastoral although not an agricultural
people.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">A new racial element.</hi> The use of polished stone weapons,
the manufacture of pottery, the hut villages and a uniform system
of burial rites distinguished the Neolithic from the Paleolithic civilization.
And, because of these differences, especially because of the
introduction of this system of burial which argues a distinctive set
of religious beliefs, in addition to the fact that the development of
this civilization from that which preceded cannot be traced on Italian
<pb n="9"/><anchor id="Pg9"/>soil, it is held with reason that at the opening of the Neolithic Age
a new race entered Italy, bringing with it the Neolithic culture.
Here and there men of the former age may have survived and copied
the arts of the newcomers, but throughout the whole peninsula the
racial unity of the population is shown by the uniformity of their
burial customs. The inhabitants of Sicily and Sardinia in this age
had a civilization of the same type as that on the mainland.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Ligurians probably a Neolithic people.</hi> It is highly probable
that one of the historic peoples of Italy was a direct survival
from the Neolithic period. This was the people called the Ligures
(Ligurians), who to a late date maintained themselves in the mountainous
district around the Gulf of Genoa. In support of this view
it may be urged (1) that tradition regarded them as one of the oldest
peoples of Italy, (2) that even when Rome was the dominant state
in Italy they occupied the whole western portion of the Po valley
and extended southward almost to Pisa, while they were believed
to have held at one time a much wider territory, (3) that at the
opening of our own era they were still in a comparatively barbarous
state, living in caves and rude huts, and (4) that the Neolithic culture
survived longest in this region, which was unaffected by the migrations
of subsequent ages.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Aeneolithic Age.</hi> The introduction of the use of copper
marks the transition from the Neolithic period to that called the
Aeneolithic, or Stone and Copper Age. This itself is but a prelude
to the true Bronze Age. Apparently copper first found its way into
Italy along the trade routes from the Danube valley and from the
eastern Mediterranean, while the local deposits were as yet unworked.
In other respects there is no great difference between the Neolithic
civilization and the Aeneolithic, and there is no evidence to place
the entrance of a new race into Italy at this time.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Bronze Age.</hi> The Bronze Age proper in Italy is marked by
the appearance of a new type of civilization—that of the builders of
the pile villages. There are two distinct forms of pile village. The
one, called <hi rend="italic">palafitte</hi>, is a true lake village, raised on a pile structure
above the waters of the surrounding lake or marsh. The other, called
<hi rend="italic"><anchor id="corr009"/><corr sic="terramara">terramare</corr></hi>, is a pile village constructed on solid ground and surrounded
by an artificial moat.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The palafitte.</hi> The traces of the <hi rend="italic">palafitte</hi> are fairly closely confined
to the Alpine lake region of Italy from Lake Maggiore to Lake
<pb n="10"/><anchor id="Pg10"/>Garda. In general, these lake villages date from an early stage of
Bronze Age culture, for later on, in most cases, their inhabitants seem
to have abandoned them for sites on dry land further to the south.
The lake-dwellers were hunters and herdsmen, but they practised
agriculture as well, raising corn and millet. In addition to their
bronze implements, they continued to use those of more primitive
materials—bone and stone. They, too, manufactured a characteristic
sort of pottery, of rather rude workmanship, which differs strikingly
from that of the Neolithic Age. In the late Bronze Age, at any
rate, they cremated their dead and buried the ashes in funerary urns.
For their earlier practice evidence is lacking.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The terramare.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">terramare</hi> settlements are found chiefly in
the Po valley; to the north of that river around Mantua, and to the
south between Piacenza and Bologna. Scattered villages have been
found throughout the peninsula; one as far south as Taranto. The
<hi rend="italic">terramare</hi> village was regularly constructed in the form of a trapezoid,
with a north and south orientation. It was surrounded by an earthen
wall, around the base of which ran a wide moat, supplied with running
water from a neighboring stream. Access to the settlement was
had by a single wooden bridge, easy to destroy in time of danger.
The space within the wall was divided in the center by a main road
running north and south the whole length of the settlement. It was
paralleled by some narrower roads and intersected at right angles by
others. On one side of this main highway was a space surrounded
by an inner moat, crossed by a bridge. This area was uninhabited
and probably devoted to religious purposes. The dwellings were
built on pile foundations along the roadways. Outside the moat was
placed the cemetery. The dead were cremated and the ashes deposited
in ossuary urns, which were laid side by side in the burial
places. The remains were rarely accompanied by anything but some
smaller vases placed in the ossuary.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The terramare civilization.</hi> With the <hi rend="italic">terramare</hi> people bronze
had almost completely supplanted stone instruments. Bronze daggers,
swords, axes, arrowheads, spearheads, razors, and pins have been
preserved in abundance. However, articles of bone and of horn were
also in general use. The <hi rend="italic">terramare</hi> civilization had likewise its special
type of hand-made pottery of peculiar shapes and ornamentation.
A characteristic form of ornamentation was the crescent-shaped handle
(<hi rend="italic">ansa lunata</hi>). The <hi rend="italic">terramare</hi> peoples were both agricultural and
<pb n="11"/><anchor id="Pg11"/>pastoral, cultivating wheat and flax and raising the better known domestic
animals; while they also hunted the stag and the wild boar.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The peoples of the palafitte and the terramare.</hi> Owing to
their custom of dwelling in pile villages, their practice of cremating
their dead, and other characteristics peculiar to their type of civilization,
the peoples of the <hi rend="italic">palafitte</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">terramare</hi> are believed to
have introduced a new racial element into Italy. The former probably
descended from the Swiss lake region, while the latter probably
came from the valley of the Danube. These peoples, abandoning the
lakes and marshes of the Po valley, spread southward over the peninsula.
Because of this expansion and because of the striking similarity
between the design of the <hi rend="italic">terramare</hi> settlements and that of the
Roman fortified camps, it has been suggested that they were the forerunners
of the Italian peoples of historic times.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Other types of Bronze Age culture in Italy.</hi> The Neolithic
population of northern Italy developed a Bronze Age civilization
under the stimulus of contact with the <hi rend="italic">terramare</hi> people and the lake-dwellers.
In the southern part of the peninsula and in Sicily, however,
the Bronze Age developed more independently, although showing
decided traces of influences from the eastern Mediterranean. Only
in its later stages does it show the effect of the southward migration
of the builders of the pile villages.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Iron Age.</hi> The prehistoric Iron Age in Italy has left extensive
remains in the northern and central regions, but such is by no
means the case in the south. The most important center of this
civilization was at Villanova, near Bologna. Here, again, we have
to do with a new type of civilization, which is not a development of
the <hi rend="italic">terramare</hi> culture. In addition to the use of iron, this age is
marked by the practice of cremation, with the employment of burial
urns of a distinctive type, placed in well tombs (<hi rend="italic">tombe a pozzo</hi>).
In Etruria, to the south of the Apennines, the Early Iron Age is of
the Villanova type. It seems fairly certain that both in Umbria and
in Etruria this civilization is the work of the Umbrians, who at one
time occupied the territory on both sides of the Apennines. Regarding
the migration of the Umbrians into Italy we know nothing, but it
seems probable that their civilization had its rise in central Europe.
The later Iron Age civilization both in Etruria and northward of the
Apennines has been identified as that of the Etruscans.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Latium.</hi> In Latium the Iron Age civilization is a development
    un<pb n="12"/><anchor id="Pg12"/>der Villanovan influences. Here a distinctive feature is the use of
a hut-shaped urn to receive the ashes of the dead. This urn was
itself deposited in a larger burial urn. This civilization is that of
the historic Latins, to whom belong also the hill villages of Latium
and the walled towns, constructed between the eighth and the sixth
centuries <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere in the northern part of Italy in the Iron Age we have
to do with a culture developing out of that of the <hi rend="italic">terramare</hi> period.
Likewise in the east and south of the peninsula the Iron Age is a
local development under outside stimulus.
</p>

<p>
The preceding sketch of the rise of civilization in Italy has brought
us down to the point where we have to do with the peoples who occupied
Italian soil at the beginning of the historic period, for from the
sixth century it is possible to attempt a connected historical record of
the movements of these Italian races.

<p>
At the close of the sixth century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, the soil of Italy was occupied
by many peoples of diverse language and origin.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Ligurians.</hi> The northwest corner of Italy, including the Po
valley as far east as the river Ticinus and the coast as far south as the
Arno, was occupied by the Ligurians.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Veneti.</hi> On the opposite side of the continental part of Italy,
in the lowlands to the north of the Po between the Alps and the
Adriatic, dwelt the Veneti, whose name is perpetuated in modern
Venice. They are generally believed to have been a people of
Illyrian origin.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Euganei.</hi> In the mountain valleys, to the east and west of
Lake Garda, lived the Euganei, a people of little historical importance,
whose racial connections are as yet unknown.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Etruscans.</hi> The central plain of the Po, between the Ligurians
to the west and the Veneti to the east, was controlled by the
Etruscans. Their territory stretched northwards to the Alps and
eastwards to the Adriatic coast. They likewise occupied the district
called after them, Etruria, to the south of the Apennines, between
the Arno and the Tiber. Throughout all this area the Etruscans
were the dominant element, although it was partly peopled by subject
Ligurians and Italians. Etruscan colonies were also established
in Campania.

</else></pgIf>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Italians.</hi> Over the central and southwestern portion of the
peninsula were spread a number of peoples speaking more or less
closely related dialects of a common, Indo-germanic, tongue. Of
these, the Latini, the Aurunci (Ausones), the Osci (Opici), the
Oenotri, and the Itali occupied, in the order named, the western coast
from the Tiber to the Straits of Rhegium. Between the valley of
the upper Tiber and the Adriatic were the Umbri, while to the south
of these, in the valleys of the central Apennines and along the
<pb n="15"/><anchor id="Pg15"/>Adriatic coast, were settled the so-called Sabellian peoples, chief of
whom were the Sabini, the Picentes, the Vestini, the Frentani, the
Marsi, the Aequi, the Hernici, the Volsci, and the Samnites. As we
have noted, one of these peoples, the Itali, gave their name to the whole
country to the south of the Alps, and eventually to this group of peoples
in general, whom we call Italians, as distinct from the other races
who inhabited Italy in antiquity.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Iapygians.</hi> Along the eastern coast from the promontory of
Mt. Garganus southwards were located the Iapygians; most probably,
like the Veneti, an Illyrian folk.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Greeks.</hi> The western and southern shores of Italy, from the
Bay of Naples to Tarentum, were fringed with a chain of Hellenic
settlements.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The peoples of Sicily.</hi> The Greeks had likewise colonized the
eastern and southern part of the island of Sicily. The central portion
of the island was still occupied by the Sicans and the Sicels,
peoples who were in possession of Sicily prior to the coming of the
Greeks, and whom some regard as an Italian, others as a Ligurian,
or Iberian, element. In the extreme west of Sicily were wedged in
the small people of the Elymians, another ethnographic puzzle.
Here too the Phoenicians from Carthage had firmly established themselves.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Iberians in Sardinia and Corsica.</hi> The inhabitants of Sardinia
and Corsica, islands which were unaffected by the migrations subsequent
to the Neolithic Age, are believed to have been of the same
stock as the Iberians of the Spanish peninsula. The Etruscans had
their colonies in eastern Corsica and the Carthaginians had obtained
a footing on the southern and western coasts of Sardinia.
</p>

<p>
From this survey of the peoples of Italy at the close of the sixth
century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, we can see that to the topographical obstacles placed by
nature in the path of the political unification of Italy there was added
a still more serious difficulty—that of racial and cultural antagonism.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Etruria.</hi> About the opening of the eighth century, the region to
the north of the Tiber, west and south of the Apennines, was occupied
by the people whom the Greeks called Tyrseni or Tyrreni, the
Romans Etrusci or Tusci, but who styled themselves Rasenna. Their
<pb n="16"/><anchor id="Pg16"/>name still clings to this section of Italy (<hi rend="italic">la Toscana</hi>), which to the
Romans was known as Etruria.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The origin of the Etruscans.</hi> Racially and linguistically the
Etruscans differed from both Italians and Hellenes, and their presence
in Italy was long a problem to historians. Now, however, it is
generally agreed that their own ancient tradition, according to which
they were immigrants from the shores of the Aegean Sea, is correct.
They were probably one of the pre-Hellenic races of the Aegean
basin, where a people called Tyrreni were found as late as the fifth
century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, and it has been suggested that they are to be identified
with the <hi rend="italic">Tursha</hi>, who appear among the Aegean invaders of Egypt
in the thirteenth century. Leaving their former abode during the
disturbances caused by the Hellenic occupation of the Aegean islands
and the west coast of Asia Minor, they eventually found a new home
on the western shore of Italy. Here they imposed their rule and their
civilization upon the previous inhabitants. The subsequent presence
of the two elements in the population of Etruria is well attested by
archaeological evidence.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Walled towns.</hi> The Etruscans regularly built their towns on
hill-tops which admitted of easy defence, but, in addition, they fortified
these towns with strong walls of stone, sometimes constructed
of rude polygonal blocks and at other times of dressed stone laid in
regular courses.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Tombs.</hi> However, the most striking memorials of the presence
of the Etruscans are their elaborate tombs. Their cemeteries contain
sepulchres of two types—trench tombs (<hi rend="italic">tombe a fossa</hi>) and chamber
tombs (<hi rend="italic">tombe a camera</hi>). The latter, a development of the former
type, are hewn in the rocky hillsides. The Etruscans practised inhumation,
depositing the dead in a stone sarcophagus. However,
under the influence of the Italian peoples with whom they came into
contact, they also employed cremation to a considerable extent. Their
larger chamber tombs were evidently family burial vaults, and were
decorated with reliefs cut on their rocky walls or with painted friezes,
from which we derive most of our information regarding the Etruscan
appearance, dress, and customs. Objects of Phoenician and Greek
manufacture found in these tombs show that the Etruscans traded
with Carthage and the Greeks as early as the seventh century.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Etruscan industries.</hi> The Etruscans worked the iron mines of
Elba and the copper deposits on the mainland. Their bronzes,
espe<pb n="17"/><anchor id="Pg17"/>cially their mirrors and candelabra, enjoyed high repute even in
fifth-century Athens. Their goldsmiths, too, fashioned elaborate
ornaments of great technical excellence. Etruria also produced the
type of black pottery with a high polish known as <hi rend="italic">bucchero nero</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Etruscan art.</hi> In general, Etruscan art as revealed in wall paintings
and in the decorations of vases and mirrors displays little originality
in choice of subjects or manner of treatment. In most cases it
is a direct and not too successful imitation of Greek models, rarely
attaining the grace and freedom of the originals.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Architecture.</hi> In their architecture, however, although even here
affected by foreign influences, the Etruscans displayed more originality
and were the teachers of the Romans and other Italians. They
made great use of the arch and vault, they created distinctive types
of column and <hi rend="italic">atrium</hi> (both later called Etruscan) and they developed
a form of temple architecture, marked by square structures
with a high <hi rend="italic">podium</hi> and a portico as deep as the <hi rend="italic">cella</hi>. Their mural
architecture has been referred to already.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Writing.</hi> Knowledge of the art of writing reached the Etruscans
from the Greek colony of Cyme, whence they adopted the Chalcidian
form of the Greek alphabet. Several thousand inscriptions in Etruscan
have been preserved, but so far all attempts to translate their
language have failed.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Religion.</hi> The religion of the Etruscans was characterized by the
great stress laid upon the art of divination and augury. Certain features
of this art, especially the use of the liver for divination, appear
to strengthen the evidence that connects the Etruscans with the eastern
Mediterranean. For them the after-world was peopled by powerful,
malicious spirits: a belief which gives a gloomy aspect to their
religion. Their circle of native gods was enlarged by the addition
of Hellenic and Italian divinities and their mythology was greatly
influenced by that of Greece.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Commerce.</hi> The Etruscans were mariners before they settled on
Italian soil and long continued to be a powerful maritime people.
They early established commercial relations with the Carthaginians
and the Greeks, as is evidenced by the contents of their tombs and
the influence of Greece upon their civilization in general. But they,
as well as the Carthaginians, were jealous of Greek expansion in the
western Mediterranean, and in 536 a combined fleet of these two
peoples forced the Phoceans to abandon their settlement on the island
<pb n="18"/><anchor id="Pg18"/>of Corsica. For the Greeks their name came to be synonymous with
pirates, on account of their depredations which extended even as far
as the Aegean.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Government.</hi> In Etruria there existed a league of twelve Etruscan
cities. However, as we know of as many as seventeen towns in this
region, it is probable that several cities were not independent members
of the league. This league was a very loose organization, religious
rather than political in its character, which did not impair the
sovereignty of its individual members. Only occasionally do several
cities seem to have joined forces for the conduct of military enterprises.
The cities at an early period were ruled by kings, but later
were under the control of powerful aristocratic families, each backed
by numerous retainers.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Expansion north of the Apennines, in Latium and in Campania.</hi>
In the course of the sixth century the Etruscans crossed the
Apennines and occupied territory in the Po valley northwards to the
Alps and eastwards to the Adriatic. Somewhat earlier, towards the
end of the seventh century, they forced their way through Latium,
established themselves in Campania, where they founded the cities of
Capua and Nola, and gradually completed the subjugation of Latium
itself. This marks the extreme limits of their expansion in Italy,
and before the opening of the fifth century their power was already
on the wane.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The decline of the Etruscan power.</hi> It was about this time that
Rome freed itself from Etruscan domination, while the other Latins,
aided by Aristodemus, the Greek tyrant of Cyme, inflicted a severe
defeat upon the Etruscans at Aricia (505 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). A land and sea
attack upon Cyme itself, in 474, resulted in the destruction of the
Etruscan fleet by Hieron, tyrant of Syracuse. The year 438 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
saw the end of the Etruscan power in Campania with the fall of
Capua before a Samnite invasion. Not long afterwards, as we shall
see, a Celtic invasion drove them from the valley of the Po. The
explanation of this rapid collapse of the Etruscan power outside
Etruria proper is that, owing to the lack of political unity, these conquests
were not national efforts but were made by independent bands
of adventurers. These failed to assimilate the conquered populations
and after a few generations were overthrown by native revolutions
or outside invasions, especially since there was no Etruscan nation
to protect them in time of need. Thus failure to develop a strong
<pb n="19"/><anchor id="Pg19"/>national state was the chief reason why the Etruscans did not unite
Italy under their dominion, as they gave promise of doing in the
course of the sixth century.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The significance of the Etruscans in the history of Italy.</hi>
Our general impression of the Etruscans is that they were a wealthy,
luxury-loving people, quick to appreciate and adopt the achievements
of others, but somewhat lacking in originality themselves. Cruel,
they took delight in gladiatorial combats, especially in Campania,
where the Romans learned this custom. Bold and energetic warriors,
as their conquests show, they lacked the spirit of discipline
and coöperation, and were incapable of developing a stable political
organization. Nevertheless, they played an important part in the
cultural development of Italy, even though here their chief mission
was the bringing of the Italian peoples into contact with Hellenic
civilization.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Greek colonization.</hi> As early as the eighth century the Greeks
had begun their colonizing activity in the western Mediterranean, and,
in the course of the next two centuries, they had settled the eastern
and southern shores of Sicily, stretched a chain of settlements on the
Italian coast from Tarentum to the Bay of Naples, and established
themselves at the mouth of the Rhone and on the Riviera. The opposition
of Carthage shut them out from the western end of Sicily, and
from Spain; the Etruscans closed to them Italy north of the Tiber;
while the joint action of these two peoples excluded them from Sardinia
and Corsica.
</p>

<p>
In the fifth century these Greek cities in Sicily and Italy were at
the height of their power and prosperity. In Sicily they had penetrated
from the coast far into the interior where they had brought the
Sicels under their domination. By the victory of Himera, in 480
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Gelon of Syracuse secured the Sicilian Greeks in the possession
of the greater part of the island and freed them from all danger of
Carthaginian invasion for over seventy years. Six years later, his
brother and successor, Hieron, in a naval battle off Cyme, struck a
crushing blow at the Etruscan naval power and delivered the mainland
Greeks from all fear of Etruscan aggression. The extreme
southwestern projection of the Italian peninsula had passed
com<pb n="20"/><anchor id="Pg20"/>pletely under Greek control, but north as far as Posidonia and east
to Tarentum their territory did not extend far from the seaboard.
In these areas they had occupied the territory of the Itali and
Oenotrians, while on the north of the Bay of Naples Cyme, Dicaearchia,
and Neapolis (Naples) were established in the land of the
Opici (Osci). The name Great Greece, given by the Hellenes to
South Italy, shows how firmly they were established there.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Lack of political unity.</hi> However, the Greeks possessed even less
political cohesion than did the Etruscans. Each colony was itself a
city-state, a sovereign independent community, owning no political
allegiance to its mother city. Thus New Greece reproduced all the
political characteristics of the Old. Only occasionally, in times of
extreme peril, did even a part of the Greek cities lay aside their
mutual jealousies and unite their forces in the common cause. Such
larger political structures as the tyrants of Syracuse built up by the
subjugation of other cities were purely ephemeral, barely outliving
their founders. The individual cities also were greatly weakened by
incessant factional strife within their walls. The result of this disunion
was to restrict the Greek expansion and, eventually, to pave
the way for the conquest of the western Greeks by the Italian
<q>barbarians.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The decline of the Greek power in Italy and Sicily.</hi> Even
before the close of the fifth century, the decline of the Western Greeks
had begun. In Italy their cities were subjected to repeated assaults
from the expanding Samnite peoples of the central Apennines. In
421, Cyme fell into the hands of a Samnite horde, and from that time
onwards the Greek cities further south were engaged in a struggle for
existence with the Lucanians and the Bruttians, peoples of Samnite
stock. In Sicily the Carthaginians renewed their assault upon the
Greeks in 408 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> For a time (404–367) the genius and energy
of Dionysius I, tyrant of Syracuse, welded the cities of the island and
the mainland into an empire which enabled them to make head
against their foes. But his empire had only been created by breaking
the power of the free cities, and after his death they were left
more disunited and weaker than ever. After further warfare, by 339,
Carthage remained in permanent occupation of the western half of the
island of Sicily, while in Italy only a few Greek towns, such as
Tarentum, Thurii, and Rhegium, were able to maintain themselves,
and that with ever increasing difficulty, against the rising tide of the
<pb n="21"/><anchor id="Pg21"/>Italians. Even by the middle of the fourth century an observant
Greek predicted the speedy disappearance of the Greek language in
the west before that of the Carthaginians or Oscans. However, their
final struggles must be postponed for later consideration.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The rôle of the Greeks in Italian history.</hi> It was the coming
of the Greeks that brought Italy into the light of history, and into
contact with the more advanced civilization of the eastern Mediterranean.
From the Greek geographers and historians we derive our
earliest information regarding the Italian peoples, and they, too,
shaped the legends that long passed for early Italian history. The
presence of the Greek towns in Italy gave a tremendous stimulus to
the cultural development of the Italians, both by direct intercourse
and indirectly through the agency of the Etruscans. In this spreading
of Greek influences, Cyme, the most northerly of the Greek colonies
and one of the earliest, played a very important part. It was
from Cyme that the Romans as well as the Etruscans took their alphabet.
The more highly developed Greek political institutions, Greek
art, Greek literature, and Greek mythology found a ready reception
among the Italian peoples and profoundly affected their political and
intellectual progress. Traces of this Greek influence are nowhere
more noticeable than in the case of Rome itself, and the
cultural <anchor id="corr021"/><corr sic="ascendency">ascendancy</corr> which Greece thus early established over Rome
was destined to last until the fall of the Roman Empire.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">I. The Latins</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Latium and the Latins.</hi> The district to the south of the Tiber,
extending along the coast to the promontory of Circeii and from the
coast inland to the slopes of the Apennines, was called in antiquity
Latium. Its inhabitants, at the opening of the historic period, were
the Latins (<hi rend="italic">Latini</hi>), a branch of the Italian stock, perhaps mingled
with the remnants of an older population.
</p>

<p>
They were mainly an agricultural and pastoral people, who had
settled on the land in <hi rend="italic">pagi</hi>, or cantons, naturally or artificially defined
rural districts. The <hi rend="italic">pagus</hi> constituted a rude political and religious
unit. Its population lived scattered in their homesteads. If
some few of the homesteads happened to be grouped together, they
constituted a <hi rend="italic">vicus</hi>, which, however, had neither a political nor a
religious organization.
</p>

<p>
At one or more points within the cantons there soon developed
small towns (<hi rend="italic">oppida</hi>), usually located on hilltops and fortified, at
first with earthen, later with stone, walls. These towns served as
market-places and as points of refuge in time of danger for the people
of the <hi rend="italic">pagus</hi>. There developed an artisan and mercantile element,
and there the aristocratic element of the population early took up
their abode, i. e., the wealthier landholders, who could leave to others
the immediate oversight of their estates. And so these <hi rend="italic">oppida</hi> became
the centers of government for the surrounding <hi rend="italic">pagi</hi>. It is very
doubtful if the Latins as a whole were ever united in a single state.
But even if that had once been the case, this loosely organized state
must early have been broken up into a number of smaller units.
These were the various <hi rend="italic">populi</hi>; that is, the cantons with their <hi rend="italic">oppida</hi>.
The names of some sixty-five of these towns are known, but before
the close of the sixth century many of the smaller of them had been
merged with their more powerful neighbors.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Latin League.</hi> The realization of the racial unity of the
<pb n="26"/><anchor id="Pg26"/>Latins was expressed in the annual festival of Jupiter Latiaris celebrated
on the Alban Mount. For a long time also the Latin cities
formed a league, of which there were thirty members according to
tradition. Actually, about the middle of the fifth century there were
only some eight cities participating in the association upon an independent
footing. The central point of the league was the grove and
temple of Diana at Aricia, and it was in the neighborhood of Aricia
that the meetings of the assembly of the league were held. The
league possessed a very loose organization, but we know of a common
executive head—the Latin dictator.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. The Origins of Rome</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The site of Rome.</hi> Rome, the Latin <hi rend="italic">Roma</hi>, is situated on the
Tiber about fifteen miles from the sea. The Rome of the later Republic
and the Empire, the City of the Seven Hills, included the
three isolated eminences of the Capitoline, Palatine and Aventine, and
the spurs of the adjoining plateau, called the Quirinal, Viminal,
Esquiline, and Caelian. Other ground, also on the left bank of the
river, and likewise part of Mount Janiculum, across the Tiber, were
included in the city. But this extent was only attained after a long
period of growth, and early Rome was a town of much smaller
area.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The growth of the city.</hi> Late Roman historians placed the
founding of Rome about the year 753 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, and used this date as a
basis for Roman chronology. However, it is absolutely impossible
to assign anything like a definite date for the establishment of the
city. Excavations have revealed that in the early Iron Age several
distinct settlements were perched upon the Roman hills, separated
from one another by low, marshy ground, flooded by the Tiber at
high water. These were probably typical Latin walled villages
(<hi rend="italic">oppida</hi>).
</p>

<p>
At a very early date some of these villages formed a religious union
commemorated in the festival of the Septimontium or Seven Mounts.
These <hi rend="italic">montes</hi> were crests of the Palatine, Esquiline and Caelian hills,
perhaps each the site of a separate settlement.
</p>

<p>
But the earliest city to which we can with certainty give the name
of Rome is of later date than the establishment of the Septimontium.
It is the Rome of the Four Regions—the Palatina, Esquilina,
Col<pb n="27"/><anchor id="Pg27"/>lina and Sucusana (later Suburana)—which included the Quirinal,
Viminal, Esquiline, Caelian and Palatine hills, as well as the intervening
low ground. Within the boundary of this city, but not
included in the four regions, was the Capitoline, which had separate
fortifications and served as the citadel (<hi rend="italic">arx</hi>). It may be that
the organization of this city of the Four Regions was effected by
Etruscan conquerors, for the name Roma seems to be of Etruscan
origin, and, for the Romans, an <hi rend="italic">urbs</hi>, as they called Rome, was merely
an <hi rend="italic">oppidum</hi> of which the limits had been marked out according to
Etruscan ritual. The consecrated boundary line drawn in this manner
was called the <hi rend="italic">pomerium</hi>.
</p>

<p>
The Aventine Hill, as well as the part of the plateau back of the
Esquiline, was only brought within the city walls in the fourth
century, and remained outside the <hi rend="italic">pomerium</hi> until the time of
Claudius.
</p>

<p>
The location of Rome, on the Tiber at a point where navigation
for sea-going vessels terminated and where an island made easy the
passage from bank to bank, marked it as a place of commercial importance.
It was at the same time the gateway between Latium and
Etruria and the natural outlet for the trade of the Tiber valley.
Furthermore, its central position in the Italian peninsula gave it a
strategic advantage in its wars for the conquest of Italy. But the
greatness of Rome was not the result of its geographic advantages:
it was the outgrowth of the energy and political capacity of its people,
qualities which became a national heritage because of the character
of the early struggles of the Roman state.
</p>

<p>
Although it is very probable that the historic population of Rome
was the result of a fusion of several racial elements—Latin, Sabine,
Etruscan, and even pre-Italian, nevertheless the Romans were essentially
a Latin people. In language, in religion, in political institutions,
they were characteristically Latin, and their history is inseparably
connected with that of the Latins as a whole.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The tradition.</hi> The traditional story of the founding of Rome
is mainly the work of Greek writers of the third century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, who
desired to find a link between the new world-power Rome and the
older centers of civilization: while the account of the reign of the
<pb n="28"/><anchor id="Pg28"/>Seven Kings is a reconstruction on the part of Roman annalists and
antiquarians, intended to explain the origins of Roman political and
religious institutions. And, in fact, owing to the absence of any
even relatively contemporaneous records (a lack from which the
Roman historians suffered as well as ourselves) it is impossible to
attempt an historical account of the period of kingly rule. We can
improve but little on the brief statement of Tacitus (i, 1 <hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi>)—<q>At
first kings ruled the city Rome.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The kingship.</hi> The existence of the kingship itself is beyond
dispute, owing to the strength of the Roman tradition on this point
and the survival of the title <hi rend="italic">rex</hi> or king in the priestly office of <hi rend="italic">rex
sacrorum</hi>. It seems certain, too, that the last of the Roman kings
were Etruscans and belong to the period of Etruscan domination in
Rome and Latium. As far as can be judged, the Roman monarchy
was not purely hereditary but elective within the royal family, like
that of the primitive Greek states, where the king was the head of one
of a group of noble families, chosen by the nobles and approved by
the people as a whole. About the end of the sixth century the kingship
was deprived of its political functions, and remained at Rome
solely as a lifelong priestly office. It is possible that there had been
a gradual decline of the royal authority before the growing power of
the nobles as had been the case at Athens, but it is very probable
that the final step in this change coincided with the fall of an Etruscan
dynasty and the passing of the control of the state into the hands
of the Latin nobility (about 508 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Institutions of the regal period.</hi> The royal power was not
absolute, for the exercise thereof was tempered by custom, by the lack
of any elaborate machinery of government, and by the practical necessity
for the king to avoid alienating the good will of the community.
The views of the aristocracy were voiced in the Senate
(<hi rend="italic">senatus</hi>) or Council of Elders, which developed into a council of
nobles, a body whose functions were primarily advisory in character.
From a very early date the Roman people were divided into thirty
groups called <hi rend="italic">curiae</hi>, and these <hi rend="italic">curiae</hi> served as the units in the
organization of the oldest popular assembly—the <hi rend="italic">comitia curiata</hi>.
Membership in the <hi rend="italic">curiae</hi> was probably hereditary, and each <hi rend="italic">curia</hi>
had its special cult, which was maintained long after the <hi rend="italic">curiae</hi> had
lost their political importance. The primitive assembly of the <hi rend="italic">curiae</hi>
was convoked at the pleasure of the king to hear matters of interest
<pb n="29"/><anchor id="Pg29"/>to the whole community. It did not have legislative power, but such
important steps as the declaration of war or the appointment of a
new <hi rend="italic">rex</hi> required its formal sanction.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Expansion under the kings.</hi> Under the kings Rome grew to be
the chief city in Latium, having absorbed several smaller Latin communities
in the immediate neighborhood, extended her territory on
the left bank of the Tiber to the seacoast, where the seaport of Ostia
was founded, and even conquered Alba Longa, the former religious
center of the Latins. It is possible that by the end of the regal period
Rome exercised a general suzerainty over the cities of the Latin plain.
The period of Etruscan domination failed to alter the Latin character
of the Roman people and left its traces chiefly in official paraphernalia,
religious practices (such as the employment of <hi rend="italic">haruspices</hi>),
military organization, and in Etruscan influences in Roman art.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Populus Romanus.</hi> The oldest name of the Romans was
<hi rend="italic">Quirites</hi>, a name which long survived in official phraseology, but
which was superseded by the name <hi rend="italic">Romani</hi>, derived from that of the
city itself. The whole body of those who were eligible to render
military service, to participate in the public religious rites and to attend
the meetings of the popular assembly, with their families, constituted
the Roman state—the <hi rend="italic">populus Romanus</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Patricians and Plebeians.</hi> At the close of the regal period the
<hi rend="italic">populus Romanus</hi> comprised two distinct social and political classes.
These were the Patricians and the Plebeians. A very considerable
element of the latter class was formed by the Clients. These class
distinctions had grown up gradually under the economic and social
influences of the early state; and, in antiquity, were not confined to
Rome but appeared in many of the Greek communities also at a
similar stage of their development.
</p>

<p>
The Patricians were the aristocracy. Their influence rested upon
their wealth as great landholders, their superiority in military equipment
and training, their clan organization, and the support of their
clients. Their position in the community assured to them political
control, and they had early monopolized the right to sit in the Senate.
The members of the Senate were called collectively <hi rend="italic">patres</hi>, whence the
name <hi rend="italic">patricii</hi> (patricians) was given to all the members of their
<pb n="30"/><anchor id="Pg30"/>class. The patricians formed a group of many <hi rend="italic">gentes</hi>, or clans, each
an association of households (<hi rend="italic">familiae</hi>) who claimed descent from
a common ancestor. Each member of a <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> bore the gentile name
and had a right to participate in its religious practices (<hi rend="italic">sacra</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Patrons and clients.</hi> Apparently, the clients were tenants who
tilled the estates of the patricians, to whom they stood for a long time
in a condition of economic and political dependence. Each head of
a patrician household was the patron of the clients who resided on
his lands. The clients were obliged to follow their patrons to war
and to the political arena, to render them respectful attention, and, on
occasion, pecuniary support. The patron, in his turn, was obliged to
protect the life and interests of his client. For either patron or client
to fail in his obligations was held to be sacrilege. This relationship,
called <hi rend="italic">patronatus</hi> on the side of the patron, <hi rend="italic">clientela</hi> on that of the
client, was hereditary on both sides. The origin of this form of
clientage is uncertain and it is impossible for us to form a very exact
idea of position of the clients in the early Roman state, for the like-named
institution of the historic republican period is by no means
the one that prevailed at the end of the monarchy. The older, serf-like,
conditions had disappeared; the relationship was voluntarily
assumed, and its obligations, now of a much less serious nature,
depended for their observance solely upon the interest of both
parties.
</p>

<p>
The patrician aristocracy formed a social caste, the product of a
long period of social development, and this caste was enlarged in
early times by the recognition of new <hi rend="italic">gentes</hi> as possessing the qualifications
of the older clans (<hi rend="italic">patres maiorum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">minorum gentium</hi>).
But eventually it became a closed order, jealous of its prerogatives
and refusing to intermarry with the non-patrician element.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Plebs.</hi> This latter constituted the plebeians or <hi rend="italic">plebs</hi>. They
were free citizens—the less wealthy landholders, tradesmen, craftsmen,
and laborers—who lacked the right to sit in the Senate and so
had no direct share in the administration. Beyond question, however,
they were included in the <hi rend="italic">curiae</hi> and had the right to vote in the
<hi rend="italic">comitia curiata</hi>. Nor is there any proof of a racial difference between
plebeians and patricians. It is not easy to determine to what
degree the clients participated in the political life of the community,
yet, in the general use of the term, the plebs included the clients, who
later, under the republic, shared in all the privileges won by the
<pb n="31"/><anchor id="Pg31"/>plebeians and who, consequently, must have had the status of plebeians
in the eye of the state.
</p>

<p>
The sharp social and political distinction between nobles and
commons, between patricians and plebeians, is the outstanding feature
of early Roman society, and affords the clue to the political development
of the early republican period.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The alliance of Rome and the Latin League, about 486 B. C.</hi>
At the close of the regal period Rome appears as the chief city in
Latium, controlling a territory of some 350 sq. miles to the south
of the Tiber. But the fall of the monarchy somewhat weakened the
position of Rome, for it brought on hostilities with the Etruscan
prince Lars Porsena of Clusium, which resulted in a defeat for Rome
and the forced acceptance of humiliating conditions.
</p>

<p>
This defeat naturally broke down whatever suzerainty Rome may
have exercised over Latium and necessitated a readjustment of the
relations between Rome and the Latin cities. A treaty attributed by
tradition to Spurius Cassius was finally concluded between Rome on
the one hand and the Latin league on the other, which fixed the relations
of the two parties for nearly one hundred and fifty years. By
this agreement the Romans and the Latin league formed an offensive
and defensive military alliance, each party contributing equal contingents
for joint military enterprises and dividing the spoils of war, while
the Latins at Rome and the Romans in the Latin cities enjoyed the
private rights of citizenship. The small people called the Hernici,
situated to the east of Latium, were early included in this alliance.
This union was cemented largely through the common dangers which
threatened the dwellers in the Latin plain from the Etruscans on the
north and the highland Italian peoples to the east and south. For
Rome it was of importance that the Latin cities interposed a barrier
between the territory of Rome and her most aggressive foes, the Aequi
and the Volsci.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Wars with the Aequi and Volsci.</hi> Of the details of these early
wars we know practically nothing. However, archæological evidence
seems to show that about the beginning of the fifth century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the
<pb n="34"/><anchor id="Pg34"/>Latins sought an outlet for their surplus population in the Volscian
land to the south east. Here they founded the settlements of Signia,
Norba and Satricum. But this expansion came to a halt, and about
the middle of the fifth century the Volsci still held their own as far
north as the vicinity of Antium, while the Aequi were in occupation of
the Latin plain as far west as Tusculum and Mt. Algidus. Towards
the end of the century, however, under Roman leadership the Latins
resumed their expansion at the expense of both these peoples.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Veii.</hi> In addition to these frequent but not continuous wars, the
Romans had to sustain a serious conflict with the powerful Etruscan
city of Veii, situated about 12 miles to the north of Rome, across the
Tiber. The causes of the struggle are uncertain, but war broke out
in 402, shortly after the Romans had gained possession of Fidenae,
a town which controlled a crossing of the Tiber above the city of
Rome. According to tradition the Romans maintained a blockade of
Veii for eleven years before it fell into their hands. It was in the
course of this war that the Romans introduced the custom of paying
their troops, a practice which enabled them to keep a force under arms
throughout the entire year if necessary. Veii was destroyed, its
population sold into slavery, and its territory incorporated in the
public land of Rome. By this annexation the area of the Roman state
was nearly doubled.
</p>

<p>
Recent excavations have shown that Veii was a place of importance
from the tenth to the end of the fifth century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, that Etruscan
influence became predominant there in the course of the eighth century,
and that, at the time of its destruction, it was a flourishing town,
which, like Rome itself, was in contact with the Greek cultural influences
then so powerful throughout the Italian peninsula.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. The Gallic Invasion</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Gauls in the Po Valley.</hi> But scarcely had the Romans
emerged victorious from the contest with Veii when a sudden disaster
overtook them from an unexpected quarter. Towards the close of
the fifth century various Celtic tribes crossed the Alpine passes and
swarmed down into the Po valley. These Gauls overcame and drove
out the Etruscans, and occupied the land from the Ticinus and Lake
Maggiore southeastwards to the Adriatic between the mouth of the
Po and Ancona. This district was subsequently known as Gallia
<pb n="35"/><anchor id="Pg35"/>Cisalpina. The Gauls formed a group of eight tribes, which were
often at enmity with one another. Each tribe was divided into
many clans, and there was continual strife between the factions of
the various chieftains. They were a barbarous people, living in rude
villages and supporting themselves by cattle-raising and agriculture
of a primitive sort. Drunkenness and love of strife were their characteristic
vices: war and oratory their passions. In stature they were
very tall; their eyes were blue and their hair blond. Brave to recklessness,
they rushed naked into battle, and the ferocity of their first
assault inspired terror even in the ranks of veteran armies. Their
weapons were long, two-edged swords of soft iron, which frequently
bent and were easily blunted, and small wicker shields. Their
armies were undisciplined mobs, greedy for plunder, but disinclined
to prolonged, strenuous effort, and utterly unskilled in siege operations.
These weaknesses nullified the effects of their victories in the
field and prevented their occupation of Italy south of the Apennines.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The sack of Rome.</hi> In 387 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, a horde of these marauders
crossed the Apennines and besieged Clusium. Thence, angered, as
was said, by the hostile actions of Roman ambassadors, they marched
directly upon Rome. The Romans marched out with all their forces
and met the Gauls near the Allia, a small tributary of the Tiber above
Fidenae. The fierce onset of the Gauls drove the Roman army in
disorder from the field. Many were slain in the rout and the majority
of the survivors were forced to take refuge within the ruined
fortifications of Veii. Deprived of their help and lacking confidence
in the weak and ill-planned walls, the citizen body evacuated Rome
itself and fled to the neighboring towns. The Capitol, however, with
its separate fortifications, was left with a small garrison. The Gauls
entered Rome and sacked the city, but failed to storm the citadel.
Apparently they had no intention of settling in Latium and therefore,
after a delay of seven months, upon information that the Veneti
were attacking their new settlements in the Po valley, they accepted
a ransom of 1000 pounds of gold (about $225,000) for the city and
marched off home. The Romans at once reoccupied and rebuilt their
city, and soon after provided it with more adequate defences in the
new wall of stone later known as the Servian wall.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Later Gallic invasions.</hi> For some years the Gauls ceased their
inroads, but in 368 another raid brought them as far as Alba in the
land of the Aequi, and the Romans feared to attack the invaders.
<pb n="36"/><anchor id="Pg36"/>However, when a fresh horde appeared in 348 the Romans were prepared.
They and their allies blocked the foe’s path, and the Gauls
retreated, fearing to risk a battle. Rome thus became the successful
champion of the Italian peoples, their bulwark against the barbarian
invaders from the north. In 334 the Gauls and the Romans concluded
peace and entered upon a period of friendly relations which
lasted for the rest of the fourth century.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. The Disruption of the Latin League and the Roman
Alliance with the Campanians: 387–334 b. c.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Wars with the Aequi, Volsci, and Etruscans.</hi> The disaster that
overtook Rome created a profound impression throughout the civilized
world and was noted by contemporary Greek writers. But the blow
left no permanent traces, for only the city, not the state, had been
destroyed. It is true that, encouraged by their enemy’s defeat, the
Aequi, Volsci and the Etruscan cities previously conquered by Rome
took up arms, but each met defeat in turn. Rome retained and consolidated
her conquests in southern Etruria. Part of the land was
allotted to Romans for settlement and four tribal districts were organized
there. On the remainder, two Latin colonies, Sutrium (383)
and Nepete (372), were founded. The territory won from the Volsci
was treated in like manner.
</p>

<p>
In 354 the Romans concluded an alliance with the Samnite peoples
of the south central Apennines. Probably this agreement was
reached in view of the common fear of Gallic invasions and because
both parties were at war with the smaller peoples dwelling between
Latium and Campania, so that a delimitation of their respective
spheres of action was deemed advisable. At any rate, it was in the
course of the next few years that Rome completely subdued the Volsci
and Aurunci, while the Samnites overran the land of the Sidicini.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Latin War, 338–336 B. C.</hi> Not long afterwards, the Latins,
allied with the Campanians, were at war with Rome. Even before
this, subsequent to the Gallic capture of Rome, the Romans had
fought with individual Latin cities, but now practically all the cities
of the Latin league were in arms against them. It is possible that
both Latins and Campanians felt their independence threatened by
the expansion and alliance of the Romans and the Samnites and that
<pb n="37"/><anchor id="Pg37"/>this was the underlying cause of hostilities. However that may be,
within two years the Latins had been completely subdued. The
Latin league ceased to exist. The individual cities, except Tibur
and Praeneste, lost their independence and were incorporated in the
Roman state. These two cities preserved their autonomy and concluded
new treaties with Rome.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Alliance with the Campanians, about 334 B. C.</hi> At about the
same time, the majority of the cities of Campania, including Capua,
concluded an alliance with Rome upon the conditions of the Roman
alliance with the old Latin league. These cities retained their independence,
and extended and received the rights of <hi rend="italic">commercium</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">connubium</hi> with Rome. This meant that the citizen of one city could
transact any business in another that was party to this agreement with
the assurance that his contract would be protected by the law of the
second city, while if he married a woman of that city his children
would be considered legitimate heirs to his property. By virtue of
this close alliance, the military resources of Campania were arrayed
on the side of Rome, and Rome and Campania presented a united
front against their common foes. The Roman sphere of influence
was thus extended as far south as the Bay of Naples.
</p>

<p>
After the Latin war, the territory previously won from the Volsci
and Aurunci was largely occupied by settlements of Roman citizens
or by Latin colonies, for even after the dissolution of the Latin league
the Romans made use of this type of colony to secure their conquests,
as well as to relieve the surplus population of Rome and Latium.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">IV. Wars with the Samnites, Gauls and Etruscans:
325–280 b. c.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The conflict of Rome and the Samnites in Campania.</hi> The
alliance of Rome and Campania brought the Romans into immediate
contact with the Samnites and converted these former friends into
enemies, since the Samnites regarded Campania as their legitimate
field for expansion and refused to submit to its passing under the
aegis of Rome. However, they had been unable to prevent the union
of Rome with Capua and other cities, for at the time they were engaged
with another enemy, the Tarentines, who were assisted by Alexander,
king of the Molossians (334–331).
</p>

<p>
The Samnites formed a loose confederacy of kindred peoples, with
<pb n="38"/><anchor id="Pg38"/>no strong central authority. Therefore, although bold and skilful
warriors, they were at a disadvantage in a long struggle where unity
of control and continuity of policy became of decisive importance.
Here Rome had the advantage, an advantage that was increased by
the alliances Rome was able to form in the course of her wars against
this enemy. For generations the excess population of the Samnite
valleys had regularly overflowed into the lowland coast areas, and such
migrations had given rise to the Lucanians, Bruttians, and a large
part of the Campanians themselves. However, the danger of being
submerged by fresh waves of Samnites caused the peoples whose
territories bordered on Samnium to look to Rome for support, and so
Rome found allies in the Central Italian peoples, and in the Apulians
and the Lucanians.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The beginning of hostilities, 325–4.</hi> Hostilities broke out over
the occupation of Naples by the Romans and its incorporation in the
Roman alliance. This step was taken in the interests of the party
in the city that sought Roman protection, and was accomplished in
spite of Samnite opposition. The war was waged chiefly in Campania,
in the valley of the upper Liris, and in Apulia. In 318, a
Roman army attempting to penetrate from Campania into Samnium
was cut off and compelled to surrender at the Caudine Pass. It is
probable that as a result of this defeat the Romans gave up Fregellae
(occupied in 328) and other territory on the Liris, and they may even
have made a temporary truce. However, hostilities were soon resumed.
Once again, in 314, the Samnites won a great victory, this
time at Lautulae not far south of Circeii, and their party acquired
control in Campania. But this temporary success was quickly counterbalanced
by Roman victories in Campanian territory.
</p>

<p>
The war was prolonged by an Etruscan attack upon Roman territory
that necessitated a division of the Roman forces. But in two
campaigns (309–7 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>), in the course of which a Roman army
advanced through Umbria and invaded northern Etruria, the cities
which had taken up arms against Rome were forced to make peace.
</p>

<p>
The war against the Samnites could be energetically prosecuted
again. By the construction of the Via Appia the Romans secured a
military highway from Rome to Capua which greatly facilitated the
conduct of operations in Campania. It is probable, too, that the
reorganization of the Roman army, which dates from this period, was
beginning to bear fruit. From both Campania and Apulia the
<pb n="39"/><anchor id="Pg39"/>Romans took the offensive, and several severe defeats forced the
Samnites to seek peace in 304. They retained their independence,
but the disputed territory on their borders fell to Rome.
</p>

<p>
It was about the close of this war that the Aequi, Marsi, Marrucini,
Frentani, Paeligni, some of the Umbrians, and other of the peoples
of Central Italy became federate allies of Rome. Apulia likewise
passed under Roman control. New Latin colonies and new tribal
districts marked the expansion of Roman territory.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Wars with the Samnites, Gauls and Etruscans, 298–80 B. C.</hi>
In 298 war broke out again between the Romans and Samnites, apparently
because the Lucanians had deserted the Roman alliance for
the Samnites. Soon the Samnites allied themselves with the Etruscans
and Gauls, and succeeded in uniting the forces of the three
peoples in Umbria. But this host was annihilated by the Romans
in the battle of Sentinum (295). With this victory all danger for
Rome was over. By systematically ravaging the enemy’s country the
Roman consuls in 290 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> forced the Samnites to sue for peace.
They entered the Roman alliance, and a portion of their land was incorporated
in the <hi rend="italic">ager publicus</hi> of Rome. A similar fate overtook
the Sabines and Picentes, who had taken sides with the Samnites.
</p>

<p>
The war with the Etruscans and the Gauls still dragged on. But
in 285, after suffering a severe blow at the hands of the Gallic
Senones, the Romans took vigorous action and drove this people from
the land between Ancona and the Rubicon—the <hi rend="italic">ager Gallicus</hi>. In
the same year the tribe of the Boii, with Etruscan allies, penetrated as
far as the Vadimonian Lake, where the Romans inflicted upon them
a crushing defeat. Another Roman victory in the next year brought
the Boii to terms, and soon the Etruscan cities one by one submitted
to Rome, until by 280 all were Roman allies.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">V. The Roman Conquest of South Italy: 281–270 b. c.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Italians and Greeks in South Italy.</hi> The only parts of the
peninsula that had not yet acknowledged the Roman overlordship
were the lands of the Lucanians and Bruttians and the few Greek
cities in the south that still maintained their independence. Of
these latter the chief was Tarentum, a city of considerable commercial
importance. From the middle of the fourth century these cities
had been engaged in continual warfare with the Lucanians and
<pb n="40"/><anchor id="Pg40"/>Messapians, and in the course of their struggles Tarentum had come
to assume the rôle of protector of the Hellenes in Italy. But even
this city had only been able to make head against its foes through
assistance obtained from Greece. In 338, King Archidamus of
Sparta, and in 331 Alexander, king of Epirus and uncle of Alexander
the Great, fell fighting in the service of the Italian Greeks.
In 303, Cleonymus of Sparta, more fortunate than his predecessors,
compelled the Lucanians to conclude a peace, which probably included
the Romans, at that moment their allies. A little later
(c. 300 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>) Agathocles, king of Syracuse, assisted the Tarentines
against the same foe, and incorporated in his own kingdom the
Bruttians and the Greek cities in the southwest. But with his death
in 289, his kingdom, like that of Dionysius I, fell apart and the
Greeks in the west were left again without a protector. Consequently,
when the Lucanians renewed their attacks upon Thurii, that city,
being unable to find succor in Greece and distrusting Tarentum, appealed
to Rome (282). Rome gave ear to the call, relieved and garrisoned
Thurii. But this action brought Roman ships of war into
the Gulf of Tarentum contrary to an agreement between the two
cities (perhaps that of 303). Enraged, the Tarentines attacked the
Roman fleet, sank some Roman triremes, and then occupied Thurii.
The ensuing Roman demands for reparation were rejected, their ambassadors
insulted, and war began (281).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The war with Pyrrhus and Tarentum.</hi> The Tarentines were
able to unite against Rome the Messapians, Lucanians, Samnites and
Bruttians, but Roman successes in the first campaign forced them to
call in the aid of Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. Pyrrhus was probably
the most skilful Greek general of the time, and he brought with him
into Italy an army organized and equipped according to the Macedonian
system of Alexander the Great, which had become the standard
in the Greek world. His force comprised 20,000 heavy-armed
infantry forming the phalanx, and 3,000 Thessalian cavalry. Besides,
he had a number of war elephants; animals which had figured
on Greek battlefields since Ipsus (301). The first engagement was
fought near Heraclea (280) and after a severe struggle the Romans
were driven from the field. The superior generalship of Pyrrhus,
and the consternation caused by his war elephants, won the day, but
his losses were very heavy, and he himself was wounded. As fighters
the Romans had shown themselves the equal of the foe, and their
<pb n="41"/><anchor id="Pg41"/>tactical organization, perfected in the Samnite Wars, had proved its
value in its first encounter with that developed by the military experts
of Greece. As a result of his victory at Heraclea, Pyrrhus was
able to advance as far north as Latium, but withdrew again without
accomplishing anything of importance. The next year, he won another
hard-fought battle near Ausculum in Apulia. Thereupon the
Romans began negotiations which Pyrrhus welcomed, sending the
orator Cineas to Rome to represent him. But, before an agreement
was reached, the Carthaginians, who feared the intervention of
Pyrrhus in Sicily, offered the Romans assistance. Their proffer was
accepted; the negotiations with Pyrrhus ended; and Rome and Carthage
bound themselves not to make a separate agreement with the
common foe, while the Carthaginian fleet was to coöperate with the
Romans.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Pyrrhus in Sicily, 278–5 B. C.</hi> Nevertheless, Pyrrhus determined
to answer an appeal from the Sicilian Greeks and to leave
Italy for Sicily. After the death of Agathocles, tyrant and king of
Syracuse (317–289), who had played the rôle of another Dionysius I,
the Greeks in Sicily had fallen upon evil days. The Carthaginians
had renewed their attacks upon them, and a new foe had appeared in
the Mamertini, Campanian mercenary soldiers who had seized Messana
and made it their headquarters for raiding the territory of the
Greek cities. Caught between these two enemies, the Greeks appealed
to Pyrrhus who came to their aid, possibly with the hope of
uniting Sicily under his own control. His success was immediate.
The Carthaginians were forced to give up all their possessions except
Lilybaeum, and Pyrrhus stood ready to carry the war into
Africa. But, at this juncture, the exactions that he laid upon his
Sicilian allies and their fear that his victory would make him their
permanent master caused them to desert his cause and make peace
with their foes. Deprived of their assistance, and seeing that his
allies in Italy were hard pressed by the Romans, he abandoned his
Sicilian venture.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The end of the war.</hi> Pyrrhus returned to Italy, with the loss
of his fleet in a naval battle with the Carthaginians, reorganized his
forces, and advanced into Lucania or Samnium to meet the Romans.
While manœuvering for an attack, one of his divisions sustained a
severe repulse at Beneventum (275), whereupon he abandoned the
offensive and retired to Tarentum. Leaving a garrison in that city
<pb n="42"/><anchor id="Pg42"/>he withdrew the rest of his forces to Greece, with the intention of
attacking Antigonus Gonatas in Macedonia. His initial successes
in this enterprise led him to withdraw his garrison from Tarentum
and abandon the Western Greeks to their fate. Thereupon the
Romans soon reduced the Samnites and Lucanians, while Tarentum
and the other Greek cities, one after another, were forced to submit
and enter the Roman alliance. By 270 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, all South Italy had
in this way been added to the Roman dominions.
</p>

<p>
By 265 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> after a few more brief struggles with revolting or
still unsubdued communities in central and northern Italy, the
Romans had completed the subjugation of the entire Italian peninsula.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Roman foreign policy.</hi> By wars and alliances Rome had united
Italy. But it is not to be supposed that this was a goal consistently
pursued through many generations by Roman statesmen. Probably
it was not until the end was nearly within sight that the Romans
realized whither their policy was leading them. Indeed, it is certain
that many of Rome’s wars were waged in defence of Rome’s territory
or that of the Roman allies. This seems particularly true of the
period prior to the Gallic inroad of 387. According to the ancient
Roman formula employed in declaring war, that uttered by the
Fetiales, war was looked upon as the last means to obtain reparation
for wrongs that were suffered at the hands of the enemy. Yet,
although the Roman attitude in such matters was doubtless at one
time sincere, we may well question how long this sincerity continued,
and whether the injuries complained of were not sometimes the result
of Roman provocation. Such attempts to place the moral responsibility
for a war upon the enemy are common to all ages and are not
always convincing. However, if we may not convict the Romans
of aggressive imperialism prior to 265, at any rate the methods
which they pursued in their relations with the other peoples of Italy
made their domination inevitable in view of the Roman national
character and their political and military organization. These
methods early became established maxims of Roman foreign policy.
The Romans, whenever possible, waged even their defensive wars
offensively, and rarely made peace save with a beaten foe. As a
rule, the enemy was forced to conclude a treaty with Rome which
<pb n="43"/><anchor id="Pg43"/>placed his forces at the disposal of the Roman state. This treaty
was regarded as perpetually binding, and any attempt to break off
the relationship it established was regarded as a <hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi>. Possibly,
the Romans looked upon this as the only policy which would
guarantee peace on their borders, but it inevitably led to further
wars, for it resulted in the continuous extension of the frontiers
defended by Rome and so continually brought Rome into contact
and conflict with new peoples. Nor were the voluntary allies of
Rome allowed to leave the Roman alliance: such action was treated
as equivalent to a declaration of war and regularly punished with
severity. This practice gradually transformed Rome’s independent
into dependent allies. From the middle of the fourth century, it
seems that Rome deliberately sought to prevent the development of
a strong state in the southern part of Italy, and to this end gladly
took under her protection weaker communities that felt themselves
threatened by stronger neighbors, although such action inevitably
led to war with the latter. Furthermore, a conquered state frequently
lost a considerable part of its territory. Portions of this land were
set aside for the foundation of fortress colonies to protect the Roman
conquests and overawe the conquered. The rest was incorporated
in the <hi rend="italic">ager Romanus</hi> to the profit of both the rich proprietors and
the landless citizens. Usually, the Roman soldiers shared directly
in the distribution of the movable spoils of war; sometimes a huge
booty, as after the subjugation of the Sabines and Picentes in 290.
A long series of successful and profitable wars, for Rome was ultimately
victorious in every struggle after 387, had engendered in the
Roman people a self-confidence and a martial spirit which soon led
them to conquests beyond the confines of Italy. During this period of
expansion within Italy, Roman policy had been guided by the Senate,
a body of unrecorded statesmen of wide outlook and great determination,
who not only made Rome mistress of the peninsula but succeeded
in laying enduring foundations for the Roman power.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Rome and Italy.</hi> But although Italy was united under the
Roman hegemony it by no means formed a single state. Rather
it was an agglomerate of many states and many peoples, speaking
different tongues and having different political institutions. The
largest single element, however, was formed by the Roman citizens.
These were to be found not only in the city of Rome and its immediate
neighborhood, but also settled in the rural tribal districts (35 in
<pb n="44"/><anchor id="Pg44"/>number after 241) organized on conquered territory throughout the
peninsula. In addition, groups of 300 citizens had been settled in
various harbor towns as a sort of resident garrison to protect Roman
interests. In all, down to 183 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, 22 of these maritime colonies
were established, whose members in view of their special duties were
excused from active service with the Roman legions. All these
were full Roman citizens, but there were others who, while enjoying
the private rights of Roman citizenship, lacked the right to vote or
to hold office (<hi rend="italic">cives sine suffragio</hi>). Such were the inhabitants of
most of the old Latin communities and some others which had been
absorbed in the Roman state. Such communities were called
<hi rend="italic">municipia</hi> (municipalities). Some of these were permitted to retain
their own magistrates and city organization: others lacked this privilege
of local autonomy. Of the former class, Gabii, conquered during
the monarchy, is said to have been the prototype. This municipal
system had the advantage of providing for local administration and
at the same time reconciling the conquered city to the loss of its
freedom. It was a distinctly Roman institution, and shows the wisdom
of the early Roman statesmen who thus marked out the way
for the complete absorption of the vanquished into the Roman citizen
body, which was thus strengthened to meet its continually increasing
military burdens. By 265, the Roman territory in Italy had an
area of about 10,000 square miles. It extended along the west coast
from the neighborhood of Caere southwards to the southern border
of Campania, and from the latitude of Rome it stretched northeastwards
through the territory of the Sabini to the Adriatic coast, where
the lands of the Picentes and the Senones had been incorporated in
the <hi rend="italic">ager Romanus</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Latin colonies.</hi> Of the non-Romans in Italy the people most
closely bound to Rome by ties of blood and common interests were
the Latin allies. Outside the few old Latin cities, that had not been
absorbed by Rome in 338, these were the inhabitants of the Latin
colonies, of which thirty-five were founded on Italian soil. Prior
to the destruction of the Latin League seven of these colonies had
been established, whose settlers had been drawn half from the Latin
cities and half from Rome. After 338, these colonies remained in
alliance with Rome, and those subsequently founded received the
same status. But for these the colonists were all supplied by Rome.
These colonists had to surrender their Roman citizenship and become
<pb n="45"/><anchor id="Pg45"/>Latins, but if any one of them left a son of military age in his place
he had the right to return to Rome. Each colony had its own
administration, usually modelled upon that of Rome, and enjoyed
the rights of <hi rend="italic">commercium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">connubium</hi> both with Rome and with
the other Latin colonies. These settlements were towns of considerable
size, having 2,500, 4,000 or 6,000 colonists, each of whom
received a grant of 30 or 50 <hi rend="italic">iugera</hi> (20 or 34 acres) of land. Founded
at strategic points on conquered territory, they formed one of the
strongest supports of the Roman authority: at the same time colonization
of this character served to relieve over-population and satisfy
land-hunger in Rome and Latium. In all their internal affairs the
Latin cities were sovereign communities, possessing, in addition to
their own laws and magistrates, the rights of coinage and census.
Their inhabitants constituted the <hi rend="italic">nomen Latinum</hi>, and, unlike the
Roman <hi rend="italic">cives sine suffragio</hi>, did not serve in the Roman legions but
formed separate detachments of horse and foot.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Italian allies.</hi> The rest of the peoples of Italy, Italian,
Greek, Illyrian and Etruscan, formed the federate allies of Rome—the
<hi rend="italic">socii Italici</hi>. These constituted some 150 separate communities,
city or tribal, each bound to Rome by a special treaty (<hi rend="italic">foedus</hi>),
whereby its specific relations to Rome were determined. In all
these treaties, however, there was one common feature, namely, the
obligation to lend military aid to Rome and to surrender to Rome
the control over their diplomatic relations with other states. Their
troops were not incorporated in the legions, but were organized as
separate infantry and cavalry units (<hi rend="italic">cohortes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">alae</hi>), raised,
equipped and officered by the communities themselves. However,
they were under the orders of the Roman generals, and if several
allied detachments were combined in one corps the whole was under
a Roman officer. The allied troops, moreover, received their subsistence
from Rome and shared equally with the Romans in the
spoils of war. In the case of the seaboard towns, especially the
Greek cities, this military obligation took the form of supplying ships
and their crews, whence these towns were called naval allies (<hi rend="italic">socii
navales</hi>). All the federate allies had <hi rend="italic">commercium</hi>, and the majority
<hi rend="italic">connubium</hi> also, with Rome. Apart from the foregoing obligations
towards Rome, each of the allied communities was autonomous, having
its own language, laws and political institutions.
</p>

<p>
However, a strong bond of sympathy existed between the local
<pb n="46"/><anchor id="Pg46"/>aristocracies of many of the Italian towns and the senatorial order
at Rome. As we have seen, the foreign relations of Rome were
directed by the Senate, which represented the views of the wealthier
landed proprietors, and it was only natural that the senators should
have sought to ally themselves with the corresponding social class
in other states. This class represented the more conservative, and,
from the Roman point of view, more dependable element, while the
support of Rome assured to the local aristocracies the control within
their own communities. Consequently there developed a community
of interest between the Senate and the propertied classes among the
Roman allies.
</p>

<p>
Thus Rome was at the head of a military and diplomatic alliance
of many separate states, whose sole point of contact was that each
was in alliance with Rome. As yet there was no such thing as an
Italian nation. Still it was from the time that this unity was
effected that the name <hi rend="italic">Italia</hi> began to be applied to the whole of the
peninsula and the term <hi rend="italic">Italici</hi> was employed, at first by foreigners,
but later by themselves, to designate its inhabitants.<note place="foot">The several elements in the Roman military federation may be seen at a glance from

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">I. The Early Republic</hi></head>

<p>
While the Romans were engaged in acquiring political supremacy
in Italy, the Roman state itself underwent a profound transformation
as the result of severe internal struggles between the patrician and
the plebeian elements.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The constitution of the early republic: the magistrates.</hi>
Upon the overthrow of the monarchy, the Romans set up a republican
form of government, where the chief executive office was filled by
popular election. At the head of the state were two annually elected
magistrates, or presidents, called at first praetors but later consuls.
They possessed the <hi rend="italic">auspicium</hi> or the right to consult the gods on
behalf of the state, and the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>, which gave them the right of
military command, as well as administrative and judicial authority.
Both enjoyed these powers in equal measure and, by his veto, the one
could suspend the other’s action. Thus from the beginning of the
Republic annuality and collegiality were the characteristics of the
Roman magistracy. Nevertheless, the Romans recognized the advantage
of an occasional concentration of all power in the state in
the hands of a single magistrate and so, in times of emergency, the
consuls, acting upon the advice of the senate, nominated a dictator,
who superseded the consuls themselves for a maximum period of six
months. The dictator, or <hi rend="italic">magister populi</hi>, as he was called in early
times, appointed as his assistant a master of the horse (<hi rend="italic">magister
equitum</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Senate.</hi> At the side of the magistrates stood the Senate, a
body of three hundred members, who acted in an advisory capacity
to the officials, and possessed the power of sanctioning or vetoing
laws passed by the Assembly of the People. The senators were
nominated by the consuls from the patrician order and held office
for life.
</p>

<pb n="48"/><anchor id="Pg48"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The comitia curiata.</hi> During the early years of the Republic,
the popular Assembly, which had the power of electing the consuls
and passing or rejecting such measures as the latter brought before
it, was probably the old <hi rend="italic">comitia curiata</hi>. But, as we shall see, it
was soon superseded in most of its functions by a new primary
assembly.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The priesthoods.</hi> In Rome a special branch of the administration
was that of public religion, which dealt with the official relations
of the community towards its divine protectors. This sphere was
under the direction of a college of priests, at whose head stood the
<hi rend="italic">pontifex maximus</hi>. Special priestly brotherhoods or guilds cared for
the performance of particular religious ceremonies, while the use of
divination in its political aspect was under the supervision of the
college of augurs. With the exception of the <hi rend="italic">pontifex maximus</hi>,
who was elected by the people from an early date, the priesthoods
were filled by nomination or coöptation. The Roman priesthood
did not form a separate caste in the community but, since these
priestly offices were held by the same men who, in another capacity,
acted as magistrates and senators, the Roman official religion was
subordinated to the interests of the state and tended more and more
to assume a purely formal character.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The lines of constitutional development.</hi> Both the consulate
and the priestly offices, like the senate, were open only to patricians,
who thus enjoyed a complete monopoly of the administration. They
had been responsible for the overthrow of the monarchy, and, consequently,
at the beginning of the Republic they formed the controlling
element in the Roman state.
</p>

<p>
From conditions such as these the constitutional development in
Rome to 287 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> proceeded along two distinct lines. In the first
place there was a gradual change in the magistracy by the creation
of new offices with functions adapted to the needs of a progressive,
expanding, community; and, secondly, there was a long struggle between
the patricians and the plebeians, resulting from the desire of
the latter to place themselves in a position of political, legal, and
social equality with the former.
</p>
            </div><div>
<index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="II. The Assembly of the Centuries and the Development of the Magistracy"/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. The Assembly of the Centuries and the Development
of the Magistracy</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Assembly of the Centuries.</hi> At a time which cannot be
<pb n="49"/><anchor id="Pg49"/>determined with precision, but most probably early in the fifth
century, the Assembly of the Curiae was superseded for elective and
legislative purposes by a new assembly, called the Assembly of the
Centuries (<hi rend="italic">comitia centuriata</hi>), of which the organization was
modelled upon the contemporary military organization of the state.
The land-holding citizens were divided into five classes, according
to the size of their properties, and to each class was allotted a number
of voting groups, divided equally between the men under 46
years of age (<hi rend="italic">juniores</hi>) and those who were 46 and over (<hi rend="italic">seniores</hi>).
The number of voting groups, called centuries, in each class was
possibly in proportion to the total assessment of that class. Thus
the first class had eighty centuries, the second, third, and fourth
classes had twenty each, while the fifth class had thirty. Outside
of the classes, at first six but later eighteen centuries were allotted to
those eligible to serve as cavalry (<hi rend="italic">equites</hi>) whose property qualification
was at least that of the first class; four centuries were given to
musicians and mechanics who performed special military service;
and one century was assigned to the landless citizens (<hi rend="italic">proletarii</hi>).
Of the total of 193 centuries, the first class had eighty and the
equestrians eighteen: together ninety-eight, or a majority of the
voting <anchor id="corr049"/><corr sic="units">units.</corr> As they had the privilege of voting before the other
classes, they could, if unanimous, control the Assembly. The term
century, it must be noted, which in its original military sense had
been applied to a detachment of 100 men, in political usage was
applied to a voting group of indefinite numbers. The organization
of this Assembly probably was not completed until near the end of
the fourth century, when the basis for enrollment in the five census
classes was changed from landed estate to the total property assessment
reckoned in terms of the copper <hi rend="italic">as</hi>.
</p>

<p>
The old Assembly of the Curiae was not abolished, but lost all its
political functions except the right to pass a law conferring the
<hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> upon the magistrates elected by the Assembly of the Centuries.
In addition to electing these magistrates the Centuriate
Assembly had the sole right of declaring war, voted upon measures
presented to it by the consuls, and acted as a supreme court of appeal
for citizens upon whom a magistrate had pronounced the death
penalty. However, the measures which the Assembly approved had
for a long time to receive subsequent ratification by the patrician
senators (the <hi rend="italic">patrum auctoritas</hi>) before they became laws binding on
the community. Finally, the importance of this sanction was nullified
<pb n="50"/><anchor id="Pg50"/>by the requirement of the Publilian (339?) and Maenian Laws that
it be given before the voting took place.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The magistracy: quaestors and aediles.</hi> It has been indicated
already that the expansion of the Roman magistracy was effected
through the creation of new offices, to which were assigned duties
that had previously been performed by the consular pair or new
functions required by the rise of new conditions in the Roman state.
</p>

<p>
The first change came in connection with the quaestorship. About
the middle of the fifth century, the officials called quaestors, who
had previously been appointed by the consuls to act as their assistants,
were raised to the status of magistrates and elected by popular vote.
Their number was originally two, but in 421 it was increased to
four, two of whom acted as officers of the public treasury (<hi rend="italic">quaestores
aerarii</hi>), while two were assigned to assist the consuls when the latter
took the field.
</p>

<p>
At approximately the same time that the quaestorship became an
elective office, the two curators of the temple of Ceres, called aediles,
likewise attained the position of public officials. They henceforth
acted as police magistrates, market commissioners, and superintendents
of public works. As we shall have occasion to note in another
connection, these aediles were elected from among the plebeians.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The censors: 443, 435?</hi> The next new office to be created was
that of censor. The censorship was a commission called into being
at five-year intervals and exercised by two men for a period of eighteen
months. The original duty of the censors was to take the census
of the citizens and their property as a basis for registering the voters
in the five classes, for compiling the roster of those eligible for military
service, and for levying the property tax (<hi rend="italic">tributum</hi>). Probably
the reason for the establishment of this office is to be sought in the
heavy demands that such duties made upon the services of the
consuls and the inability of the latter to complete the census within
any one consular year. The censors further had charge of the
letting of public contracts, and, by the end of the fourth century had
acquired the right to compile the list of the senators. As this latter
duty involved an enquiry into the habits of life of the senators, there
arose that aspect of the censors’ power which alone has survived
in the modern conception of a censorship.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The military tribunes with consular power.</hi> During the
period 436 to 362, on fifty-one occasions the consular college of
<pb n="51"/><anchor id="Pg51"/>two was displaced by a board of military tribunes with consular
power (<hi rend="italic">tribuni militum consulari potestate</hi>). The number of these
military tribunes varied: there were never less than three, more often
four or six, while two boards had eight and nine tribunes respectively.
As their name indicates, these were essentially military officers, and
this lends support to the tradition that they were elected because the
military situation frequently demanded the presence in the state of
more than two magistrates who could exercise the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The praetorship.</hi> However, by 362 this method of meeting the
increased burdens of the magistracy was definitely abandoned. For
the future two consuls were annually elected, and, in addition, a
magistrate called the praetor, to whom was assigned the administration
of the civil jurisdiction within the city. The praetor was regarded
as a minor colleague of the consuls and held the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>.
Consequently, if need arose, he could take command in the field or
exercise the other consular functions.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The curule aediles.</hi> In the same year there was established
the curule aedileship. The two curule aediles were at first elected
from the patricians only, and, although their duties seem to have
been the same as those of the plebeian aediles, their office was considered
more honorable than that of the latter.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Promagistrates.</hi> The Roman magistrates were elected for one
year only, and after 342 reëlection to the same office could only be
sought after an interval of ten years. This system entailed some
inconveniences, especially in the conduct of military operations, for
in the case of campaigns that lasted longer than one year the consul
in command had to give place to his successor as soon as his own
term of office had expired. Thus the state was unable to utilize for
a longer period the services of men who had displayed special military
capacity. The difficulty was eventually overcome by the prolongation,
at the discretion of the Senate, of the command of a consul
in the field for an indefinite period after the lapse of his consulship.
The person whose term of office was thus extended was no longer
a consul, but acted <q>in the place of a consul</q> (<hi rend="italic">pro consule</hi>). This
was the origin of the promagistracy. It first appeared in the campaign
at Naples in 325, and, although for a time employed but
rarely, its use eventually became very widespread.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Characteristics of the magistracy.</hi> Thus the Roman magistracy
attained the form that it preserved until the end of the Republic.
<pb n="52"/><anchor id="Pg52"/>It consisted of a number of committees, each of which, with the
exception of the quaestorship, had a separate sphere of action. But
among these committees there was a regularly established order of
rank, running, from lowest to highest, as follows: quaestors, aediles,
censors, praetors, consuls. With the exception of the censorship that
was regularly filled by ex-consuls, the magistracies were usually
held in the above order. Magistrates of higher rank enjoyed greater
authority than all those who ranked below them, and as a rule could
forbid or annul the actions of the latter. A magistrate could also
veto the action of his colleague in office. In this way the consuls
were able to control the activities of all other regular magistrates.
However, the extraordinary office of the dictatorship outranked the
consulship and consequently the dictator could suspend the action
of the consuls themselves. The unity that was thus given to the
administration by this conception of <hi rend="italic">maior potestas</hi> was increased
by the presence of the Senate, a council whose influence over the
magistracy grew in proportion as the consulate lost in power and
independence through the creation of new offices.
</p>
            </div><div>
                <index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="III. The Plebeian Struggle for Political Equality"/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. The Plebeian Struggle for Political Equality</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The causes of the struggle.</hi> Of greater moment in the early
history of the republic than the development of the magistracy was
the persistent effort made by the plebeians to secure for themselves
admission to all the offices and privileges that at the beginning of
the republic were monopolized by the patricians. Their demands
were vigorously opposed by the latter, whose position was sustained
by tradition, by their control of the organs of government, by individual
and class prestige, and by the support of their numerous clients.
But among the plebeians there was an ever increasing number whose
fortunes ranked with those of the patricians and who refused to be
excluded from the government. These furnished the leaders among
the plebs. However, a factor of greater importance than the presence
of this element in determining the final outcome of the struggle
was the demand made upon the military resources of the state by
the numerous foreign wars. The plebeian soldiers shared equally
with the patricians in the dangers of the field, and equality of
political rights could not long be withheld from them. As their
services were essential to the state, the patrician senators were
far<pb n="53"/><anchor id="Pg53"/>sighted enough to make concessions to their demands whenever a
refusal would have led to civil warfare. A great cause of discontent
on the part of the plebs was the indebtedness of the poorer landholders,
caused in great part by their enforced absence from their
lands upon military service and the burden of the <hi rend="italic">tributum</hi> or property
tax levied for military purposes. Their condition was rendered the
more intolerable because of the operation of the harsh debtor laws,
which permitted the creditor to seize the person of the debtor and
to sell him into slavery.
</p>

<p>
Evidence that discontent was rife at Rome may be found in the
tradition of three unsuccessful attempts to set up a tyranny, that is,
to seize power by unconstitutional means, made by Spurius Cassius
(478), Spurius Maelius (431), and Marcus Manlius (376), patricians
who figure in later tradition as popular champions.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The tribunes of the plebs (466 B. C.), and the assembly of
the tribes.</hi> The first success won by the plebeians was in securing
protection against unjust or oppressive acts on the part of the patrician
magistrates. In 466, they forced the patricians to acquiesce in the
appointment of four tribunes of the plebs, officers who had the right
to extend protection to all who sought their aid, even against the
magistrate in the exercise of his functions.<note place="foot">Another, but apparently later, Roman tradition placed the establishment of the
tribunate in 494, when two tribunes were elected, and merely attributes an increase in
their number to 466.</note> The tribunes received
power to make effective use of this right from an oath taken by the
plebeians that they would treat as accursed and put to death without
trial any person who disregarded the tribune’s veto or violated the
sanctity of his person. The character of the tribunate and the basis
of its power reveal it as the result of a revolutionary movement and
as existing in defiance of the patricians. The tribunes were elected
in an assembly in which the voting units were tribes, and the number
of the tribunes (four) suggests that this assembly was at first composed
of the citizens of the four city regions or tribes, and that it
was the city plebs who were responsible for the establishment of the
tribunate. In this assembly we have the origin of the <hi rend="italic">comitia tributa</hi>
or Assembly of the Tribes.
</p>

<p>
The origin of these tribes is uncertain, but by the middle of the
fifth century the Roman state was divided into twenty or twenty-one
districts, each of which with the citizens resident therein constituted
a <hi rend="italic">tribus</hi>. Four of these were located in the city: the remainder were
<pb n="54"/><anchor id="Pg54"/>rural. In the preceding chapter we have seen how the number of
the tribes was increased with the incorporation of conquered territory
within the Roman state and its occupation by Roman colonists. The
tribes were artificial divisions of the community, and served as a
basis for the raising of the levy and the <hi rend="italic">tributum</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Plebeian aediles.</hi> Associated with the tribunes as officers of
the plebs were two aediles (<hi rend="italic">aediles plebi</hi>). It has been conjectured
that they were originally the curators of the temple of Ceres (established
492?), which was in a special sense a plebeian shrine. As
we have seen they later became magistrates of the whole people.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The codification of the law.</hi> About the middle of the fifth century
the plebeians secured the codification and publication of the
law. Hitherto the law, which consisted essentially of customs and
precedents, and was largely sacral in character, had been known only
to the magistrates and to the priests, that is to members of the
patrician order. At this time, two commissions of ten men each,
working in successive years (444–2?) drew up these customs into a
code, which, with subsequent additions, formed what was later called
the Law of the XII Tables. This code was in no sense a constitution,
but embodied provisions of both civil and criminal law, with
rules for legal procedure and police regulations. Notable is the
provision which guaranteed the right of appeal to the Assembly of
the Centuries in capital cases.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Development of the tribunate and the comitia tributa.</hi> The
years which saw the publication of the code mark an important stage
in the struggle of the orders. Serious trouble arose between the
patricians and the plebs under the second college of law-givers, and
the difference was only settled by a treaty which restored the tribunate,
that had been suspended when the decemvirs were first elected.
Henceforth the number of tribunes was ten instead of four and their
position and powers received legal recognition from the patricians.
From this time on, too, the <hi rend="italic">comitia tributa</hi>, now embracing all the
tribes, the rural as well as the urban, was a regular institution of
the state. The Assembly of the Tribes was originally, and perhaps
always remained in theory, restricted to the <anchor id="corr054"/><corr sic="plebians">plebeians</corr>. And it is
improbable that the patricians ever sought to participate in it. At
any rate, there is no adequate reason for believing in the existence of
two assemblies of this sort, the one composed of both patricians and
plebeians and the other of plebeians only.
</p>

<pb n="55"/><anchor id="Pg55"/>

<p>
The Assembly of the Tribes not only elected the plebeian tribunes
and aediles, but soon chose the quaestors also. Furthermore, the
patrician magistrates, finding this Assembly in many ways more
convenient for the transaction of public business than the Assembly
of the Centuries which met in the Campus Martius outside the
<hi rend="italic">pomerium</hi> and required more time to register its opinion because of
the greater number of voting units, began to convene it to approve
measures, which, if previously sanctioned by a decree of the Senate,
became law. The tribunes likewise presented resolutions to the Assembly
of the Tribes, and these, too, if sanctioned by the Senate,
were binding on the whole community. Such laws were called
plebiscites (<hi rend="italic">plebi scita</hi>) in contrast with the <hi rend="italic">leges</hi> passed by an assembly
presided over by a magistrate with <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>. It became the
ambition of the tribunes to obtain for their plebiscites the force of
law <anchor id="corr055"/><corr sic="wthout">without</corr> regard to the Senate’s approval.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The lex Canuleia.</hi> The social stigma which rested upon the
plebeians because they could not effect a legal marriage with the
patricians, a disability that had been maintained by the law of the
XII Tables, was removed by the Canuleian Law in 437.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The plebs and the magistracy.</hi> The plebeians did not rest
content with having spokesmen and defenders in the tribunes: they
also demanded admission to the consulate and the Senate. In 421
plebeians were admitted to the quaestorship, and by that time the
plebeian aediles could be looked upon as magistrates, but the patricians
tenaciously maintained their monopoly of the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> until,
in 396, a plebeian was elected a military tribune with consular power.<note place="foot">One explanation of the origin of this tribunate offered in antiquity and still held in
some quarters is that it was created to take the place of the consulship as an office to
which plebeians might be admitted while they were still excluded from the regular
presidency. Against this view, besides the existence of another explanation equally old
which has been adopted above, it may be urged that although the military tribunate first
appeared in 436 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> it was not until 40 years later that plebeians were elected to it.
And further, plebeians only appear in six of the fifty-one colleges of military tribunes
elected between 436 and 362.</note>
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the appearance of plebeian military tribunes at this time
may be explained on the ground that the vicissitudes of the war with
Veii forced the patricians to accept as magistrates the ablest available
men in the state even if of plebeian origin.
</p>

<p>
With the military tribunate the plebeians had held an office that
conferred the right to the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>. Consequently, when the consulship
was definitely reëstablished in 362, they could not logically be
excluded from it. In 362 the first plebeian consul was elected, but
<pb n="56"/><anchor id="Pg56"/>it was not until 340 that the practice became established that one
consul must, and the other might, be a plebeian.
</p>

<p>
After their admission to the consulship the plebeians were eligible
to all the other magistracies. They gained the dictatorship in 356,
the censorship in 351, and the praetorship in 337. Eventually, the
curule aedileship also was opened to them, and was held by patricians
and plebeians in alternate years.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The plebs and the Senate.</hi> Since the custom was early established
that ex-consuls, and later ex-praetors, should be enrolled in
the Senate, with the opening of these offices to the plebs the latter
began to have an ever-increasing representation in that body. As
distinguished from the <hi rend="italic">patres</hi> or patrician senators, the plebeians
were called <hi rend="italic">conscripti</hi>, <q>the enrolled,</q> and this distinction was preserved
in the official formula <hi rend="italic">patres conscripti</hi> used in addressing the
Senate. In this fusion of the leading plebeians with the patricians
in the Senate we have the origin of a new aristocracy in the Roman
state: the so-called senatorial aristocracy or <hi rend="italic">nobilitas</hi>. This consisted
of a large group of influential patrician and plebeian families
which, for some time at least, was continuously quickened and revivified
by the accession of prominent plebeians who entered the
Senate by way of the magistracies. Thus the Senate, by opening its
ranks to the leaders of the plebs, contrived to emerge from the
struggle with its prestige and influence increased rather than impaired.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Appius Claudius, censor, 310 B. C.</hi> An episode which illustrates
the growing democratic tendencies of the time is the censorship of
Appius Claudius, in 310, whose office is memorable for the construction
of the Via Appia and the Aqua Appia, Rome’s first aqueduct.
In his revision of the Senate, Appius ventured to include
among the senators persons who were the sons of freedmen, and he
permitted the landless population of the city to enroll themselves in
whatever tribal district they pleased. This latter step was taken to
increase the power of the city plebs, who had previously been confined
to the four city tribes, but who might now spread their votes over
the rural districts, of which there were now twenty-seven. However,
the work of Appius was soon undone. The consuls refused to recognize
the senatorial list prepared by him and his colleague, and the
following censors again restricted the city plebs to the urban tribes.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The plebs and the priesthood.</hi> The last stronghold of patrician
privilege was the priesthood which was opened to the plebeians by
<pb n="57"/><anchor id="Pg57"/>the Ogulnian Law of 300 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> The number of pontiffs and augurs
was increased and the new positions were filled by plebeians. The
patricians could no longer make use of religious law and practice
to hamper the political activity of the plebs.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Hortensian <anchor id="corr057"/><corr sic="law">Law</corr>, 287 B. C.</hi> The end of the struggle between
the orders came with the secession of 287 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Apparently this
crisis was produced by the demands of the farming population who
had become heavily burdened with debt as a result of the economic
strain put upon them by the long Samnite wars. Refusal to meet
their demands led to a schism, and the plebeian soldiers under arms
seceded to the Janiculum. A dictator, Quintus Hortensius, appointed
for the purpose, settled the differences and passed a <hi rend="italic">lex
Hortensia</hi>, which provided that for the future all measures passed
in the <hi rend="italic">comitia tributa</hi>, even without the previous approval of the
Senate, should become binding on the whole state. Thus the Assembly
of the Tribes as a legislative body acquired greater independence
than the Assembly of the Centuries.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The two assemblies of the people.</hi> Henceforth, the Assembly
of the Tribes tended to become more and more the legislative assembly
<hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi>, while the Assembly of the Centuries remained the chief
elective assembly. For legislative purposes the Assembly of the
Tribes could be convened by a magistrate with <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> or by a
tribune; for the election of the plebeian tribunes and aediles it had
to be summoned by a tribune; while to elect the quaestors and curule
aediles it must be called together by a magistrate. For all purposes
the Assembly of the Centuries had to be convened and presided over
by a magistrate. It elected the consuls, praetors, censors and, eventually,
twenty-four military tribunes for the annual levy. It must be
kept in mind that these were both primary assemblies, that each comprised
the whole body of Roman citizens, but that they differed
essentially in the organization of the voting groups. As we have
seen the wealthier classes dominated the Assembly of the Centuries,
but in the Assembly of the Tribes, which was the more democratic
body, a simple majority determined the vote of each tribe.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The increased importance of the tribunate.</hi> The importance
of the tribunes was greatly enhanced by the Hortensian Law, as
well as by various privileges which they had already acquired by 287
or gained shortly after that date. The more important of these
powers were the right to sit in the Senate, to address, and even to
<pb n="58"/><anchor id="Pg58"/>convene that body, and the right to prosecute any magistrate before
the <hi rend="italic">comitia tributa</hi>. The first of these powers was a development
of the tribunician veto, whereby this was given to a proposal under
discussion in the Senate rather than upon a magistrate’s attempt to
execute it after it had taken the form of a law or a senatorial decree.
To permit the tribunes to interpose their veto at this stage they had
to be allowed to hear the debates in the Senate. At first they did
so from their bench which they set at the door of the meeting-place,
but finally they were permitted to enter the council hall itself.
The power of prosecution made the tribunes the guardians of the
interests of the state against any misconduct on the part of a magistrate.
From this time on the tribunes have practically the status
of magistrates of the Roman people.
</p>

<p>
The struggle of the orders left its mark on the Roman constitution
in providing Rome with a double set of organs of government. The
tribunate, plebeian aedileship, and <hi rend="italic">comitia tributa</hi> arose as purely
plebeian institutions, but they came to be incorporated in the governmental
organization of the state along with the magistracies and
the assemblies that had always been institutions of the whole Roman
people.
</p>

  <index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="IV. The Roman Military System"/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">IV. The Roman Military System</hi></head>

<p>
Upon the history of no people has the character of its military
institutions exercised a more profound effect than upon that of Rome.
The Roman military system rested upon the universal obligation of
the male citizens to render military service, but the degree to which
this obligation was enforced varied greatly at different periods. For
the mobilization of the man power of the state was dependent upon
the type of equipment, methods of fighting, and organization of
tactical units in vogue at various times, as well as upon the ability
of the state to equip its troops and the strength of the martial spirit
of the people.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The army of the primitive state.</hi> In all probability the earliest
Roman army was one of the Homeric type, where the nobles who
went to the battlefield on horseback or in chariots were the decisive
factor and the common folk counted for little.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The phalanx organization.</hi> However, at an early date, under
Etruscan influences according to tradition, the Romans adopted the
<pb n="59"/><anchor id="Pg59"/>phalanx organization, making their tactical unit the long deep line
of infantry armed with lance and shield. Those who were able to
provide themselves with the armor necessary for taking their place in
the phalanx formed the <hi rend="italic">classis</hi> or <q>levy.</q> The rest were said to be
<hi rend="italic">infra classem</hi>, and were only called upon to act as light troops. But
military necessities compelled the state to incorporate with the heavy-armed
infantry increasingly large contingents of the less wealthy
citizens, who could not provide themselves with the full equipment
of those in the <hi rend="italic">classis</hi>, but who could form the rear ranks of the
phalanx. As a result of this step the citizens were ultimately divided
into five orders or classes on the basis of their property, and probably
in raising the levy the required number of soldiers of each class was
drafted in equal proportions from the several tribes. The first three
classes constituted the phalanx, while the fourth and fifth continued
to serve as light troops (<hi rend="italic">rorarii</hi>). Those who lacked the property
qualification of the lowest class were only called into service in cases
of great emergency. For such a system the taking of an accurate
census was essential, and it is more than likely that the office of
censor was instituted for this purpose. As we have seen, it was
from this organization of the people for military purposes that there
developed the Assembly of the Centuries.
</p>

<p>
The introduction of pay for the troops in the field at the time
of the siege of Veii both lessened the economic burden which service
entailed upon the poorer soldiers and enabled the Romans to undertake
campaigns of longer duration, even such as involved winter
operations.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The manipular legion.</hi> How long the phalanx organization
was maintained we do not know: at any rate it did not survive the
Samnite wars. In its place appeared the legionary formation, in
which the largest unit was the legion of about four thousand infantry,
divided into maniples of one hundred and twenty (or sixty) men,
each capable of manœuvering independently. This arrangement admitted
of increased flexibility of movement in broken country, and
of the adoption of the <hi rend="italic">pilum</hi>, or javelin, as a missile weapon. Both
the <hi rend="italic">pilum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">scutum</hi>, or oblong shield, were of Samnite origin.
While reorganizing their infantry, the Romans strengthened the <hi rend="italic">equites</hi>
and developed them as a real cavalry force.
</p>

<p>
Apparently property qualifications no longer counted for much
in the army organization, as the men were assigned to their places in
<pb n="60"/><anchor id="Pg60"/>the ranks on the basis of age and experience, and the state furnished
the necessary weapons to those who did not provide their own. By
the third century, all able-bodied men holding property valued at
4000 asses were regularly called upon for military service. The
others were liable to naval service, but only in cases of great need
were they enrolled in the legions. Ordinarily, the service required
amounted to sixteen campaigns in the infantry and ten in the cavalry.
The field army was raised from those between seventeen and forty-six
years of age: those forty-six and over were liable only for garrison
duty in the city. The regular annual levy consisted of four legions,
besides 1800 cavalry. This number could be increased at need,
and the Roman forces in the field were supplemented by at least an
equal number in the contingents from the Italian allies.
</p>

<p>
The Roman army was thus a national levy: a militia. It was
commanded by the consuls, the annually elected presidents of the
state. Yet it avoided the characteristic weaknesses of militia troops,
for the frequency of the Roman wars and the length of the period of
liability for service assured the presence of a large quota of veterans
in each levy and maintained a high standard of military efficiency.
Furthermore, the consuls, if not always good generals, were generally
experienced soldiers, for a record of ten campaigns was required of
the candidate for public office. Likewise their subordinates, the
military tribunes, were veterans, having seen some five and others ten
years’ service. But the factor that contributed above all else to the
success of the Roman armies was their iron discipline. The consular
<hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> gave its holder absolute power over the lives of the soldiers
in the field, and death was the penalty for neglect of duty, disobedience,
or cowardice. The most striking proof of the discipline
of the Roman armies is that after every march they were required
to construct a fortified camp, laid out according to fixed rules and
protected by a ditch, a wall of earth, and a palisade for which they
carried the stakes. No matter how strenuous their labors had been,
they never neglected this task, in striking contrast to the Greek citizen
armies which could not be induced to construct works of this kind.
The fortified camp rendered the Romans safe from surprise <anchor id="corr060"/><corr sic="attacks">attacks,</corr>
allowed them to choose their own time for joining battle, and gave
them a secure refuge after a defeat. It played a very large part
in the operations of the Roman armies, especially such as were conducted
in hostile territory.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">I. Early Roman Religion</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Animism.</hi> The Roman religion of the historic republic was a
composite of beliefs and ceremonies of various origins. The basic
stratum of this system was the Roman element: religious ideas that
the Romans probably held in common with the other Latin and
Italian peoples. Although traces of a belief in magic; and of the
worship of natural objects and animals, survived from earlier stages
of religious development, it was <q>animism</q> that formed the basis
of what we may call the characteristic Roman religious ideas. Animism
is the belief that natural objects are the abode of spirits more
powerful than man, and that all natural forces and processes are
the expression of the activity of similar spirits. When such powers
or <hi rend="italic">numina</hi> were conceived as personalities with definite names they
became ‘gods,’ <hi rend="italic">dei</hi>. And because the primitive Roman gods were
the spirits of an earlier age, for a long time the Romans worshipped
them without images or temples. But each divinity was regarded
as residing in a certain locality and only there could his worship
be conducted. The true Roman gods lacked human attributes: their
power was admitted but they inspired no personal devotion. Consequently,
Roman theology consisted in the knowledge of these deities
and their powers and of the ceremonial acts necessary to influence
them.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The importance of ritual.</hi> The Romans, while recognizing
their dependence upon divine powers, considered that their relation
to them was of the nature of a contract. If man observed all proper
ritual in his worship, the god was bound to act propitiously: if the
god granted man’s desire he must be rewarded with an offering. If
man failed in his duty, the god punished him: if the god refused
to hearken, man was not bound to continue his worship. Thus
Roman religion consisted essentially in the performance of ritual,
wherein the correctness of the performance was the chief factor.
</p>

<pb n="62"/><anchor id="Pg62"/>

<p>
But since the power of the gods could affect the community as
well as the individual, it was necessary for the state to observe with
the same scrupulous care as the latter its obligations towards them.
The knowledge of these obligations and how they were to be performed
constituted the sacred law of Rome, which became a very
important part of the public law. This sacred law was guarded by
the priesthood, and here we have the source of the power of the
pontiffs in the Roman state. The pontiffs not only preserved the
sacred traditions and customs but they also added to them by interpretation
and the establishment of new precedents. The pontiffs
themselves performed or supervised the performance of all public
acts of a purely religious nature, and likewise prescribed the ritual
to be observed by the magistrate in initiating public acts.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand the power of the augurs rested upon the belief
that the gods issued their warnings to men through natural signs,
and that it was possible to discover the attitude of the gods towards
any contemplated human action by the observation of natural
phenomena. For the augurs were the guardians of the science of
the interpretation of such signs or auspices in so far as the state
was concerned. The magistrate initiating any important public act
had to take the auspices, and if the augurs declared any flaw therein
or held that any unfavorable omen had occurred during the performance
of the said act, they could suspend the magistrate’s action
or render it invalid.
</p>

<p>
So we see that the Roman priests were not intermediaries between
the individual Roman and his gods, but rather, as has been pointed
out before, officers in charge of one branch of the public administration.
They were responsible for the due observance of the public
religious acts, just as the head of the household supervised the performance
of the family cult.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The cult of the household.</hi> It is in the cult of the household
that we can best see the true Roman religious ideas. The chief
divinities of the household were: Janus, the spirit of the doorway;
Vesta, the spirit of the fire on the hearth; the Penates, the guardian
spirits of the store-chamber; the Lar Familiaris, which we may perhaps
regard as the spirit of the cultivated land; and the Genius of
the head of the house, originally, it is probable, the spirit of his
generative powers, which became symbolic of the life of the family
as a whole.
</p>

<pb n="63"/><anchor id="Pg63"/>

<p>
The Romans, strictly speaking, did not practice ancestor-worship.
But they believed that the spirits of the departed were affected by
the ministrations of the living, and, in case these were omitted, might
exercise a baneful influence upon the fortunes of their descendants.
Hence came the obligation to remember the dead with offerings at
stated times in the year.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The cult of the fields.</hi> As early Rome was essentially an agricultural
community, most of its divinities and festivals had to do
with the various phases of agricultural life. Festivals of the sowing,
the harvest, the vineyard and the like, were annually celebrated in
common, at fixed seasons, by the households of the various <hi rend="italic">pagi</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The state cult.</hi> The public or state cult of Rome consisted
mainly in the performance of certain of the rites of the household
and of the <hi rend="italic">pagi</hi> by or for the people as a whole. The state cult of
Vesta and of the Penates, as well as the festival of the Ambarvalia,
the annual solemn purification of the fields, are of this nature. But,
in addition, the state religion included the worship of certain divinities
whose personalities and powers were conceived with greater distinctness.
At the beginning of the Republic the chief of these gods
were the triad Juppiter, Juno, and Minerva. Juppiter Optimus
Maximus, called also Capitolinus from his place of worship, was
originally a god of the sky. But, adorned with various other attributes,
he was finally worshipped as the chief protecting divinity
of the Roman State. Juno was the female counterpart of Juppiter
and was the great patron goddess of women. Another important
deity was Mars, at one time an agricultural divinity, who in the
state religion developed into the god of warlike, <q>martial,</q> activities.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Foreign influences.</hi> It was in connection with the state worship
that foreign influences were first felt. Indeed, it is probable that
the association of Juppiter with Juno and Minerva was due to contact
with Etruria. It was from the Etruscans also that the Romans
derived their knowledge of temple construction, the earliest example
of which was probably the temple of Juppiter on the Capitoline said
to have been dedicated in 508 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> The use of images was likewise
due to Etruscan influences, although here as in other respects
Greek ideas may have been at work. In general the Romans did
not regard the gods of strange people with hostility, but rather admitted
their power and sought to conciliate them. Thus they frequently
transferred to Rome the gods of states that they had conquered
<pb n="64"/><anchor id="Pg64"/>or absorbed. Other foreign divinities, too, on various grounds were
added to the circle of the divine protectors of the Roman state.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Religion and morality.</hi> From the foregoing sketch it will be
seen that the Roman religion did not have profound moral and elevating
influences. Its hold upon the Roman people was chiefly due to
the fact that it symbolized the unity of the various groups whose
members participated in the same worship; i. e. the unity of the
family and the unity of the state. Nevertheless, the idea of obligation
inherent in the Roman conception of the relation between gods
and men and the stress laid upon the exact performance of ritual
inevitably developed among the Romans a strong sense of duty, a
moral factor of considerable value. Further, the power of precedent
and tradition in their religion helped to develop and strengthen the
conservatism so characteristic of the Roman people.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. Early Roman Society</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The household.</hi> The cornerstone of the Roman social structure
was the household (<hi rend="italic">familia</hi>). That is to say, the state was an association
of households, and it was the individual’s position in a household
that determined his status in the early community. The Roman
household was a larger unit than our family. It comprised the father
or head of the household (<hi rend="italic">pater familias</hi>), his wife, his sons with
their wives and children, if they had such, his unmarried daughters,
and the household slaves.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The patria potestas.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">pater familias</hi> possessed authority over
all other members of the household. His power over the free members
was called <hi rend="italic">patria potestas</hi>, <q>paternal authority</q>; over the slaves
it was <hi rend="italic">dominium</hi>, <q>lordship.</q> This paternal authority was in theory
unrestricted and gave the father the right to inflict the death penalty
upon those under his power. But, in practice, the exercise of the
<hi rend="italic">patria potestas</hi> was limited by custom and by the habit of consulting
the older male members of the household before any important action
was taken.
</p>

<p>
The household estate (<hi rend="italic">res familiaris</hi>) was administered by the
head of the household. At the death of a <hi rend="italic">pater familias</hi> his sons in
turn became the head of <hi rend="italic">familiae</hi>, dividing the estate. The mother
and unmarried daughters, if surviving, now passed into the power
of a son or the next nearest male relative of the deceased. Although
<pb n="65"/><anchor id="Pg65"/>the Roman women were thus continually in the position of wards,
they nevertheless took a prominent part in the life of the household
and did not live the restricted and secluded lives of the women of
Athens and the Greek cities of Asia.
</p>

<p>
Membership in the household was reckoned only through male
descent, for daughters when they married passed out of the <hi rend="italic">manus</hi>
or <q>power</q> of the head of their own household into that of the
head of the household to which their husbands belonged.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Education.</hi> The training of the Roman youth at this time was
mainly of a practical nature. There was as yet little interest in
intellectual pursuits and no Roman literature had been developed.
The art of writing, it is true, had long been known and was employed
in the keeping of records and accounts. Such instruction as there
was, was given by the father to his sons. It consisted probably of
athletic exercises, of practical training in agricultural pursuits, in
the traditions of the state and of the Roman heroes, and in the
conduct of public business through attendance at places where this
was transacted.
</p>

<p>
At the age of eighteen the young Roman entered upon a new footing
in relation to the state. He was now liable to military service and
qualified to attend the <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi>. In these respects he was emancipated
from the paternal authority. If he attained a magistracy, his father
obeyed him like any other citizen.
</p>

<p>
The discipline and respect for authority which was acquired in the
family life was carried with him by the Roman into his public
relations, and this sense of duty was perhaps the strongest quality in
the Roman character. It was supplemented by the characteristic
Roman seriousness (<hi rend="italic">gravitas</hi>), developed under the stress of the long
struggles for existence waged by the early Roman state. In the
Roman the highest virtue was piety (<hi rend="italic">pietas</hi>), which meant the dutiful
performance of all one’s obligations, to the gods, to one’s kinsmen,
and to the state. The Romans were preëminently a practical people,
and their practical virtues laid the foundation for their political
greatness.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The mos maiorum.</hi> We have already referred to the conservatism
of the Romans, and have seen how this characteristic was affected
by their religious beliefs. It was further strengthened by the respect
paid to parental authority and by the absence of intellectual training.
In public affairs this conservatism was shown by the influence of
<pb n="66"/><anchor id="Pg66"/>ancestral custom—the <hi rend="italic">mos maiorum</hi>. In the Roman government
this became a very potent factor, since the Roman constitution was
not a single comprehensive document but consisted of a number of
separate enactments supplemented by custom and precedent and interpreted
in the light thereof.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Rome a world power.</hi> With the unification of the Italian peninsula
Rome entered upon a new era in her foreign relations. She
was now one of the great powers of the Mediterranean world and was
inevitably drawn into the vortex of world politics. She could no
longer rest indifferent to what went on beyond the confines of Italy.
She assumed new responsibilities, opened up new diplomatic relations,
developed a new outlook and new ambitions. At this time
the other first-class powers were, in the east, the three Hellenistic
monarchies—Egypt, Syria, and Macedon,—which had emerged
from the ruins of the empire of Alexander the Great, and, in the
west, the city state of Carthage.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Egypt.</hi> The kingdom of Egypt, ruled by the dynasty of the
Ptolemies, comprised the ancient kingdom of Egypt in the Nile
valley, Cyrene, the coast of Syria, Cyprus, and a number of cities
on the shores and islands of the Aegean Sea. In Egypt the Ptolemies
ruled as foreigners over the subject native population. They maintained
their authority by a small mercenary army recruited chiefly
from Macedonians and Greeks, and by a strongly centralized administration,
of which the offices were in Greek hands. As the ruler was
the sole proprietor of the land of Egypt, the native Egyptians, the
majority of whom were peasants who gained their livelihood by tilling
the rich soil of the Nile valley, were for the most part tenants of the
crown, and the restrictions and obligations to which they were subject
rendered their status little better than that of serfs. A highly developed
but oppressive system of taxation and government monopolies,
largely an inheritance from previous dynasties, enabled the Ptolemies
to wring from their subjects the revenues with which they maintained
<pb n="69"/><anchor id="Pg69"/>a brilliant court life at their capital, Alexandria, and financed their
imperial policy.
</p>
<anchor id="illus-083"/>
<pgIf output="txt"><then>
  <p rend="ill">[Illustration: The Expansion of Rome in the Mediterranean World 265–44 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>]</p>

  <p><figure url="images/illus-083.png"><figDesc>The Expansion of Rome in the Mediterranean World 265–44 B. C.</figDesc></figure></p>
</else></pgIf>
<p>
The aim of this policy was to secure Egyptian domination in the
Aegean, among the states of Southern Greece, and in Phoenicia, whose
value lay in the forests of the Lebanon mountains. To carry it
into effect the Ptolemies were obliged to support a navy which would
give them the command of the sea in the eastern Mediterranean.
However, the occupation of their outlying possessions brought Egypt
into perpetual conflict with Macedon and Syria, whose rulers made
continued efforts to oust the Ptolemies from the Aegean and from
the Syrian coast.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Syria.</hi> Syria, the kingdom of the Seleucids, with its capital at
Antioch on the Orontes, was by far the largest of the Hellenistic
monarchies in extent and population, and in wealth it ranked next
to Egypt. It stretched from the Aegean to the borders of India, and
included the southern part of Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, Persia, and
northern Syria. But the very size of this kingdom was a source of
weakness, because of the distances which separated its various provinces
and the heterogeneous racial elements which it embraced. The
power of the dynasty was upheld, as in Egypt, by a mercenary army,
and also by the Greek cities which had been founded in large numbers
by Alexander the Great and his successors. However, these
islands of Greek culture did not succeed to any great extent in Hellenizing
the native populations which remained in a state of subjection,
indifferent or hostile to their conquerors. Furthermore the strength of
the Seleucid empire was sapped by repeated revolts in its eastern
provinces and dissensions between the members of the dynasty itself.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Macedon.</hi> The kingdom of Macedon, ruled by the house of the
Antigonids, was the smallest of the three in extent, population and
resources, but possessed an internal strength and solidarity lacking
in the others. For in Macedon, the Antigonids, by preserving the
traditional character of the patriarchal monarchy, kept alive the national
spirit of the Macedonians and made them loyal to the dynasty.
They also retained a military system which fostered the traditions
of the times of Philip II and Alexander, and which, since the Macedonian
people had not lost its martial character, furnished a small
but efficient national army. Outside of Macedon, the Antigonids
held sway over Thessaly and the eastern part of Greece as far south
as the Isthmus of Corinth. Their attempts to dominate the whole
<pb n="70"/><anchor id="Pg70"/>peninsula were thwarted by the opposition of the Aetolian and Achaian
Confederacies, who were supported in this by the Ptolemies.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The minor Greek states.</hi> In addition to these three great monarchies
we should note as powers of minor importance the Confederacies
mentioned before, the kingdom of Pergamon on the northwest
coast of Asia Minor, the island republic of Rhodes, which was a
naval power of considerable strength, and the kingdom of Syracuse
in Sicily, the last of the independent Greek cities on that island.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Carthage.</hi> The fourth world power was Carthage, a city state
situated on the northern coast of Africa, opposite the western end
of the island of Sicily, which had created for itself an empire that
controlled the western half of the Mediterranean. Carthage was
founded as a colony of the Phoenician city of Tyre about 814 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
In the sixth century, with the passing of the cities of Phoenicia
under the domination, first of Babylon, and later of the Persian
Empire, their colonies in the western Mediterranean severed political
ties with their mother land and had henceforth to maintain themselves
by their own efforts.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Carthaginian Empire.</hi> Their weakness was the opportunity
of Carthage, which, in the sixth and following centuries, brought
under her control the other Phoenician settlements, in addition to
founding new colonies of her own. She also extended her sway over
the native Libyan population in the vicinity of Carthage. These
Libyans were henceforth tributary and under the obligation of rendering
military service to the Carthaginians: similar obligations rested
upon the dependent Phoenician allies. In the third century the
Carthaginian empire included the northern coast of Africa from the
Gulf of Syrtis westwards beyond the Straits of Gibraltar, the southern
and eastern coasts of Spain as far north as Cape Nao, Corsica, Sardinia,
and Sicily, with the exception of Messana in the extreme northeast
and the Kingdom of Syracuse in the southeastern part of the
island. The smaller islands of the western Mediterranean were likewise
under Carthaginian control.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The government of Carthage.</hi> At this time the government of
Carthage itself was republican in form and strongly aristocratic in
tone. There was a primary Assembly for all Carthaginian citizens
who could satisfy certain age and property requirements. This body
annually elected the two chief magistrates or suffetes, and likewise
the generals. For the former qualifications of wealth and merit were
<pb n="71"/><anchor id="Pg71"/>prescribed. There was also a Senate, and a Council, whose organization
and powers are uncertain. The Council, the smaller body, prepared
the matters to be discussed in the Senate, which was consulted
by the Suffetes on all matters and usually gave the final decision,
although the Assembly was supposed to be consulted in case the
Senate and Suffetes disagreed. The Suffetes exercised judicial, financial
and religious functions, and presided over the council and senate.
The Carthaginian aristocracy, like that of Venice, was a group
of wealthy families whose fortunes, made in commercial ventures,
were handed down for generations in the same houses. From this
circle came the members of the council and senate, who directed the
policy of the state. The aristocracy itself was split into factions,
struggling to control the offices and through them the public policy,
which they frequently subordinated to their own particular interests.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The commercial policy of Carthage.</hi> The prosperity of Carthage
depended upon her empire and the maintenance of a commercial
monopoly in the western Mediterranean. This policy of commercial
exclusiveness had caused Carthage to oppose Greek colonial expansion
in Spain, Sardinia and Sicily, and had led to treaties which
placed definite limits upon the trading ventures of the Romans and
their allies, and of the Greeks from Massalia and her colonies in
France and northern Spain.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Carthaginian naval and <anchor id="corr071"/><corr sic="militry">military</corr> strength.</hi> Such a policy
could only be maintained by a strong naval power, and, in fact,
Carthage was the undisputed mistress of the seas west of the straits
of Messana. Unlike Rome, however, Carthage had no organized
national army but relied upon an army of mercenaries recruited
from all quarters of the Mediterranean, among such warlike peoples
as the Gauls, Spaniards, Libyans and Greeks. Although brave and
skillful fighters, these, like all troops of the type, were liable to
become dispirited and mutinous under continued reverses or when
faced by shortage of pay and plunder.
</p>

<p>
Such was the state with which Rome was now brought face to face
by the conquest of South Italy and which was the first power she
was to challenge in a war for dominion beyond the peninsula. As
we have seen, Rome had long ere this come into contact with this great
maritime people.<note place="foot">To the Romans the Carthaginians were known as <hi rend="italic">Poeni</hi>, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, Phoenicians, whence
comes the adjective <q>Punic,</q> used in such phrases as the <q>Punic Wars.</q></note> Two treaties, one perhaps dating from the close
<pb n="72"/><anchor id="Pg72"/>of the sixth century, and the other from 348 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, regulated commercial
intercourse between the two states and their respective subjects
and allies. A third, concluded in 279, had provided for military
coöperation against Pyrrhus, but this alliance had ceased after
the defeat of the latter, and with the removal of this common enemy a
feeling of coolness or mutual suspicion seems to have arisen between
the erstwhile allies.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. The First Punic War: 264–241 b. c.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The origins of the war.</hi> The first war between Rome and Carthage
arose out of the political situation in the island of Sicily. There
the town of Messana was occupied by the Mamertini, a band of
Campanian mercenaries, who had been in the service of Syracuse
but who had deserted and seized this town about 284 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Because
of their perpetual acts of brigandage they were a menace to their
neighbors, the Syracusans. The latter, now under an energetic ruler,
Hiero, who had assumed the title of king, in 265 succeeded in blockading
Messana and its ultimate capture seemed certain. In despair
the Mamertini sought help from the Carthaginians who sent a garrison
to Messana, for they looked with jealousy upon any extension of
Syracusan territory. However, the majority of the Mamertini sought
to be taken under the protection of Rome and appealed to the Roman
Senate for aid. The senators on the one hand saw that to espouse
the cause of the Mamertini would be to provoke a war with Carthage,
an eventuality before which they shrank, but on the other hand they
recognized that the Carthaginian occupation of Messana would give
them the control of the Straits of Messana and constitute a perpetual
threat against southern Italy. The strength of these conflicting considerations
made them unwilling to assume responsibility for a decision
and they referred the matter to the Assembly of the Centuries.
Here the people, elated, apparently, by their recent victorious wars in
Italy, and led on by hopes of pecuniary advantage to be derived from
the war, decided to admit the Mamertini to the Roman alliance. One
consul, Appius Claudius, was sent with a small force to relieve the
town (264).
</p>

<p>
The Mamertini induced the Carthaginian garrison to withdraw, and
then admitted the Roman force which crossed the straits with the aid
of vessels furnished by their Greek allies in Italy. Thereupon the
<pb n="73"/><anchor id="Pg73"/>Carthaginians made an alliance with the Syracusans, but the Romans
defeated each of them.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Alliance of Rome and Syracuse.</hi> In the next year the Romans
sent a larger army into Sicily to attack Syracuse and met with such
success that Hiero became alarmed, and, making peace upon easy
terms, concluded an alliance with them for fifteen years.<note place="foot">This alliance was renewed in 248 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi></note> Aided by
Hiero the Romans now began an attack upon Agrigentum, the Carthaginian
stronghold which threatened Syracuse. When this was taken in
262, they determined to drive the Carthaginians from the whole island.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Rome builds a fleet.</hi> However, Roman operations in Sicily could
only be conducted at considerable risk and the coasts of Italy remained
exposed to continued raids as long as Carthage had undisputed
control of the sea. Consequently the Romans decided to build
a fleet that would put an end to the Carthaginian naval supremacy.
They constructed 120 vessels, of which 100 were of the type called
quinquiremes, the regular first class battleships of the day. The complement
of each was three hundred rowers and one hundred and
twenty fighting men.<note place="foot">See W. W. Tarn, <q>The Fleets of the First Punic War,</q> <hi rend="italic">Journal of Hellenic Studies</hi>,
1907, p. 51, n. 19.</note> With this armament, and some vessels from
the Roman allies, the consul, Gaius Duilius, put to sea in 260 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
and won a decisive battle off Mylae on the north coast of Sicily. As
a result of this battle in the next year the Romans were able to occupy
Corsica and attack Sardinia, and finding it impossible to force a decision
in Sicily, they were in a position to attack Carthage in Africa
itself.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Roman invasion of Africa, 256 B. C.</hi> Another naval victory,
off Ecnomus, on the south coast of Sicily, cleared the way for the
successful landing of an army under the consul Marcus Atilius Regulus.
He defeated the Carthaginians in battle and reduced them to
such extremities that they sought to make peace. But the terms which
Atilius proposed were so harsh that in desperation they resumed hostilities.
At this juncture there arrived at Carthage, with other mercenaries,
a Spartan soldier of fortune, Xantippus, who reorganized the
Carthaginian army. By the skilful use of cavalry and war elephants
he inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Romans and took Atilius prisoner.
A Roman fleet rescued the remnants of the expedition, but was
almost totally lost in a storm off the southern Sicilian coast (255).
</p>

<pb n="74"/><anchor id="Pg74"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The war in Sicily, 254–241 B. C.</hi> The Romans again concentrated
their efforts against the Carthaginian strongholds in Sicily,
which they attacked from land and sea. In 254 they took the important
city of Panormus, and the Carthaginians were soon confined
to the western extremity of the island. There, however, they successfully
maintained themselves in Drepana and Lilybaeum. Meantime
the Romans encountered a series of disasters on the sea. In 253
they lost a number of ships on the voyage from Lilybaeum to Rome,
in 250 the consul Publius Clodius suffered a severe defeat in a naval
battle at Drepana, and in the next year a third fleet was destroyed by
a storm off Phintias in Sicily.
</p>

<p>
In 247 a new Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, took command
in Sicily and infused new life into the Carthaginian forces. From
the citadel of Hercte first, and later from Eryx, he continually harassed
the Romans not only in Sicily but even on the coast of Italy.
Finally, in 242 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, when their public treasury was too exhausted to
build another fleet, the Romans by private subscription equipped 200
vessels, which undertook the blockade of Lilybaeum and Drepana.
A Carthaginian relief expedition was destroyed off the Aegates Islands,
and it was impossible for their forces, now completely cut off in
Sicily, to prolong the struggle. Carthage was compelled to conclude
peace in 241 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The terms of peace.</hi> Carthage surrendered to Rome her remaining
possessions in Sicily, with the islands between Sicily and Italy,
besides agreeing to pay an indemnity of 3200 talents (about
$3,500,000) in twenty years. For the Romans the long struggle had
been very costly. At sea alone they had lost in the neighborhood of
500 ships and 200,000 men. But again the Roman military system
had proven its worth against a mercenary army, and the excellence
of the Roman soldiery had more than compensated for the weakness
in the custom of annually changing commanders. Moreover, the military
federation which Rome had created in Italy had stood the test of
a long and weary war, without any disloyalty being manifest among
her allies. On the other hand, the losses of Carthage had been even
more heavy, and, most serious of all, her sea power was broken and
Rome controlled the western Mediterranean.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The revolt of the Carthaginian mercenaries.</hi> Weakened as she
was after the contest with Rome, Carthage became immediately thereafter
involved in a life and death struggle with her mercenary troops.
<pb n="75"/><anchor id="Pg75"/>These, upon their return from Sicily, made demands upon the state
which the latter found hard to meet and consequently refused. Thereupon
the mercenaries mutinied and, joining with the native Libyans
and the inhabitants of the subject Phoenician cities (Libyphoenicians),
entered upon a war for the destruction of Carthage. After a
struggle of more than three years, in which the most shocking barbarities
were practised on either side and in which they were brought
face to face with utter ruin, the Carthaginians under the leadership
of Hamilcar Barca stamped out the revolt (238 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Rome acquires Sardinia.</hi> Up to this point Rome had looked on
without interference, but now, when Carthage sought to recover Sardinia
from the mutinous garrison there, she declared war. Carthage
could not think of accepting the challenge and bought peace at the
price of Sardinia and Corsica and 1200 talents ($1,500,000). This
unjustifiable act of the Romans rankled sore in the memories of the
Carthaginians.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. The Illyrian and Gallic Wars: 229–219 b. c.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The first Illyrian war: 229–228 B. C.</hi> In assuming control of
the relations of her allies with foreign states, Rome had assumed responsibility
for protecting their interests, and it was the fulfillment
of this obligation which brought the Roman arms to the eastern shores
of the Adriatic.
</p>

<p>
Under a king named Agron an extensive but loosely organized
state had been formed among the Illyrians, a semibarbarous people
inhabiting the Adriatic coast to the north of Epirus. These Illyrians
were allied with the kingdom of Macedonia and sided with the latter
in its wars with Epirus and the Aetolian and Achaean Confederacies.
In 231 Agron died and was succeeded by his queen Teuta, who continued
his policy of attacking the cities on the west coast of Greece
and practising piracy on a large scale in the Adriatic and Ionian seas.
Among those who suffered thereby were the south Italian cities, which
in 230 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> as the result of fresh and more serious outrages appealed
to Rome for redress. Thereupon the Romans demanded satisfaction
from Teuta and, upon their demands being contemptuously rejected,
they declared war.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Romans cross the Adriatic: 229 B. C.</hi> In the next spring,
229 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, the Romans sent against the Illyrians a fleet and an army
<pb n="76"/><anchor id="Pg76"/>of such strength that the latter could offer but little resistance and in
the next year were forced to sue for peace. Teuta had to give up a
large part of her territory, to bind herself not to send a fleet into the
Ionian sea, and to pay tribute to Rome. Corcyra, Epidamnus, Apollonia,
and other cities became Roman allies.
</p>

<p>
The fact that Rome first crossed the Adriatic to prosecute a war
against the Illyrians placed her in hostility to their ally, Macedonia,
the greatest of the Greek states. And although Macedonia had been
unable to offer aid to the Illyrians because of dynastic troubles that
had followed the death of King Demetrius (229 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>), the Macedonians
regarded with jealous suspicion Rome’s success and the establishment
of a Roman sphere of influence east of the Adriatic.
Conversely, the war had established friendly relations and coöperation
between Rome and the foes of Macedon, the Aetolian and
Achaean Confederacies, which rejoiced in the accession of such a powerful
friend. The way was thus paved for the participation of Rome,
as a partizan of the anti-Macedonian faction, in the struggles which
had so long divided the Greek world.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The second Illyrian war: 220–219 B. C.</hi> The revival of Macedonian
influence led indirectly to Rome’s second Illyrian war. The
alliance of Antigonus Doson with the Achaean Confederacy and his
conquest of Sparta (222 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>) united almost the whole of Greece
under Macedonian suzerainty. Thereupon Demetrius of Pharos, a
despot whose rule Rome had established in Corcyra, went over to
Macedonia, attacked the cities allied with Rome, and sent a piratical
squadron into Greek waters (220 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). Rome, now threatened with
a second Carthaginian War, acted with energy. Macedonia, under
Philip V, the successor of Antigonus Doson, was involved in a war
with the Aetolians and their allies. Deprived of support from this
quarter Demetrius was speedily driven to take refuge in flight. His
subjects surrendered and Rome took possession of his chief fortresses,
Pharos and Dimillos.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">War with the Gauls in North Italy: 225–22 B. C.</hi> In the interval
between these Illyrian Wars Rome became involved in a serious
conflict with the Gallic tribes settled in the Po valley. For about
half a century this people had lived at peace with Rome, ceasing their
raids into the peninsula and becoming a prosperous agricultural and
pastoral people. It is claimed that they became alarmed at the
Roman assignment of the public land on their southern borders, called
the Ager Gallicus, to individual colonists in 233 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, and that this
<pb n="77"/><anchor id="Pg77"/>caused them to take up arms. However, this territory had been
Roman since 283 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> and its settlement could hardly have been
interpreted as an hostile act. More probable is it that the cause of
the new Gallic invasion was the coming of fresh swarms from across
the Alps, which some of the Cisalpine Gauls, who had forgotten the
defeats of the previous generation, perhaps invited, and certainly
joined, for the sake of plunder. In 238 such a band of Transalpines
crossed the Roman frontier and penetrated as far as Ariminum, but
serious dissensions broke out within their own ranks and they had to
withdraw. There was no further inroad attempted until 225 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Gallic invasion of 225 B. C.</hi> In that year a formidable
horde, called the Gasatae, crossed the Alps and, joined by the Boii
and Insubres, prepared to invade Roman territory with a force of
50,000 foot and 20,000 mounted men. The Romans and Italians
were seriously alarmed, for the memory of the fatal day of the Allia
had never been effaced. Rome called for a military census of her
whole federation. The lists showed 700,000 infantry and 70,000
cavalry. Expecting the Gauls to advance into Umbria the Romans
stationed an army under one consul at Ariminum. The other consul
was sent to Sardinia, possibly from fear of a Carthaginian attack,
while the defence of Etruria was left to a force of Roman allies. Alliances
were concluded with the Cenomani, a Gallic tribe to the
north of the Po, and with the Veneti.
</p>

<p>
Avoiding the army at Ariminum the Gauls crossed the Apennines
into Etruria, defeated the Roman allies and plundered the country.
But the consul from Ariminum hastened to the rescue, the army in
Sardinia was recalled, and the Gauls began to withdraw northwards
to place their spoils in safety. The Romans followed and as the
army from Sardinia landed to the north of the foe and cut off their
retreat, the latter were surrounded and brought to bay at Telamon.
They were annihilated in a bloody battle won by the superiority of
the Roman tactics and generalship. One of the Roman consuls fell
on the field of battle.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">War against the Boii and Insubres: 224–222 B. C.</hi> Italy was
saved, and now the Romans decided to expel the Boii and the
Insubres from the Po valley as a penalty for their conduct and to
prevent future invasions of this sort by occupying their territory. In
three hard-fought campaigns the Romans, while they failed to exterminate
or dispossess these peoples, reduced them to subjection, forcing
them to surrender part of their territory and to pay tribute. But the
<pb n="78"/><anchor id="Pg78"/>Romans did not conquer without suffering heavy losses, and their
ultimate success was to a considerable degree due to the coöperation
of the Cenomani.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Roman frontier reaches the Alps.</hi> Between 221 and 219
the Romans subdued the peoples of the Adriatic coast as far as the
peninsula of Istria. Thus, with the exception of Liguria and the
upper valley of the Po, all Italy to the south of the Alps was brought
within the sphere of Roman influence. The Latin colonies Placentia
and Cremona were founded in the territory taken from the Insubres to
secure the Roman authority in this region, but Hannibal’s invasion
of 217 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> found the Cisalpine Gauls ready to revolt against the
Roman yoke.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Carthaginian expansion in Spain.</hi> As we have seen, the Roman
seizure of Sardinia and Corsica and the exaction of a fresh indemnity
in 238 left a longing for revenge in the hearts of the dominant faction
at Carthage. This faction was led by Hamilcar Barca, the
victor of the mercenary war, who saw in Spain the opportunity for
repairing the fortunes of his state, for compensating Carthage for the
loss of Sicily and Sardinia, and for developing an army that would
enable him to face the Romans on an equal footing. The Phoenician
subjects of Carthage were hard pressed by the attacks of the
native Iberian peoples when he secured for himself the command
of the Carthaginian forces in the peninsula (238 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). By skilful
generalship and able diplomacy he extended the Carthaginian dominion
over many of the Spanish tribes, and created a strong army,
devoted to himself and his family.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Hasdrubal.</hi> Consequently, when Hamilcar died in battle in 229
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he was succeeded in the command by his son-in-law Hasdrubal,
who carried on his predecessor’s policy. He it was who founded the
town of New Carthage (Carthagena) to serve as the center of Carthaginian
influence in Spain. The annual revenue of from 2000
to 3000 talents ($2,400,000 to $3,000,000) derived from the Spanish
silver mines readily induced the Carthaginians to acquiesce in the
almost regal position that the Barcidae enjoyed in Spain. Thus the
latter could carry out their plans without interference from the home
government.
</p>

<pb n="79"/><anchor id="Pg79"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Hasdrubal’s treaty with Rome, 226 B. C.</hi> But the Carthaginian
advance in Spain aroused the alarm of the Greeks of Massalia, and
of her colonies, Emporiae and Rhodae, whose commercial interests
and independence were thereby endangered. Now the Massaliots
had long been in alliance with Rome,—they were said to have contributed
to the ransom which the Romans paid to the Gauls in
387 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>,—and there seems little doubt that they secured the intervention
of Rome on their behalf. In 226 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the Romans concluded
a treaty with Hasdrubal which bound him not to send an
armed force north of the river Ebro. A few years later the Romans
entered into a defensive alliance with the Spanish town of Saguntum,
which lay to the south of the Ebro, but which was not subject to
Carthage. The motive of the Romans in making this alliance is
obscure, but it was probably in answer to a request from the Saguntines.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Hannibal.</hi> Upon the assassination of Hasdrubal in 221, Hannibal,
son of Hamilcar, then in his twenty-sixth year, was appointed
to the command in Spain. Thereupon, relying upon the army which
his predecessors and he himself had built up in Spain and upon the
resources of the Carthaginian dominions there, he resolved to take a
step which would inevitably lead to war with Rome, namely, to attack
Saguntum.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The siege of Saguntum: 219 B. C.</hi> Using as a pretext a dispute
between the Saguntines and some of his Spanish allies, he laid
siege to the town in 219 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> and captured it after a siege of eight
months. A Roman embassy appeared at Carthage to demand the
surrender of Hannibal and his staff as the price of averting war with
Rome. But the anti-Roman party was in the majority and the Carthaginian
senate accepted the responsibility for the act of their general,
whatever its consequences might be. The Roman ambassador
replied with the declaration of war.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Roman plan of campaign.</hi> The most fateful result of the
First Punic War had been the destruction of the maritime supremacy
of Carthage. She never subsequently thought of contesting Rome’s
dominion on the sea, and consequently, while extending her empire
in Spain and Africa she had neglected to rebuild her navy. This
fact was to be of decisive importance in the coming struggle. Rome,
relying upon it, planned an offensive war. One army, under the
consul Publius Cornelius Scipio, was to proceed to Spain, supported
<pb n="80"/><anchor id="Pg80"/>by the fleet of Massalia, and to detain Hannibal there, while a second
army, under the other consul, Tiberius Sempronius, was assembled
in Sicily to embark for Africa.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The plan of Hannibal.</hi> But the Romans had not taken into
account the military genius of Hannibal, whose audacious plan of
carrying the war into Italy upset their calculations. Realizing that
he could not transport his army to Italy by sea, he was prepared to
cross the Pyrenees, traverse southern Gaul and, crossing the Alps,
descend upon Italy from the north. Among the Gauls of the Po
valley he hoped to find recruits for his army, and expected that, once
he was in Italy, the Roman allies would seize this opportunity of
recovering their independence. Deprived of their support Rome
would have to yield. His ultimate object was not the destruction of
Rome, but the breaking up of the Roman federation in Italy, and the
reduction of the Roman state to the limits attained in 340 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> This
purpose is apparent from the plan of campaign which he followed
after his arrival in Italy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Hannibal’s march into Italy.</hi> Hannibal’s preparations were
more advanced than those of the Romans and, early in the spring of
218 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, he set out from New Carthage for the Pyrenees. Forcing
a passage there, he left the passes under guard and resumed his march
with a picked army of Spaniards and Numidians. His brother Hasdrubal
was left in Spain to collect reinforcements and follow with
them. Hannibal arrived at the Rhone and crossed it by the time
that Scipio reached Massalia on his way to Spain. The latter, failing
to force Hannibal to give battle on the banks of the Rhone, returned
in person to Italy, but decided to send his army, under the command
of his brother, to Spain, a decision which had the most serious consequences
for Carthage. Meanwhile Hannibal continued his march
and, overcoming the opposition of the peoples whose territory he
traversed, as well as the more serious obstacles of bad roads, dangerous
passes, cold, and hunger, he crossed the Alps and descended into
the plain of North Italy in the autumn of 218, after a march of five
months.<note place="foot">Authorities differ as to the pass which Hannibal used in crossing the Alps, arguing
variously for the Little St. Bernard, Mont Genèvre or Mont Cenis. Polybius, our best
authority, seems to indicate the Little St. Bernard. A recent discussion of the problem
is Spencer Wilkinson’s <hi rend="italic">Hannibal’s March across the Alps</hi>, London, 1917.</note> His army was reduced to 20,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry.
Practically all his elephants perished.
</p>

<p>
Hannibal at once found support and an opportunity to rest his
<pb n="81"/><anchor id="Pg81"/>weary troops among the Insubres and the Boii, the latter of whom
had already taken up arms against the Romans. At the news of his
arrival in Italy Sempronius was at once recalled from Sicily, but
Scipio who had anticipated him ventured to attack Hannibal with
the forces under his command. He was beaten in a skirmish at the
river Ticinus, and Hannibal was able to cross the Po. Upon the
arrival of Sempronius, both consuls attacked the Carthaginians at
the Trebia, only to receive a crushing defeat (December, 218).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Hannibal invades the peninsula: 217 B. C.</hi> Hannibal wintered
in north Italy and in the spring, with an army raised to 50,000 by
the addition of Celtic recruits, prepared to invade the peninsula.
The Romans divided their forces, stationing one consul at Ariminum
and the other at Arretium in Etruria. Hannibal chose to cross the
Apennines and the marshes of Etruria, where he surprised and
annihilated the army of the consul Flaminius at the Trasimene Lake
(217 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). Flaminius himself was among the slain. This victory
was soon followed by a second in which the cavalry of the army of the
second consul was cut to pieces. Hannibal began his attempt to
detach the Italians from the Roman alliance by releasing his Italian
prisoners to carry word to their cities that he had come to set them
free. Thereupon he marched into Samnium, ravaging the Roman
territory as he went.
</p>

<p>
The Romans in great consternation chose a dictator, Quintus Fabius
Maximus. Fabius recognized the superiority of Hannibal’s
generalship and of the Carthaginian cavalry, and consequently refused
to be drawn into a general engagement. But he followed the
enemy closely and continually threatened an attack, so that Hannibal
could not divide his forces for purposes of raiding and foraging.
Still he was able to penetrate into Campania and thence to recross
the mountains into Apulia, where he decided to establish winter quarters.
The strategy of Fabius, which had not prevented the enemy
from securing supplies and devastating wide areas, grew so irksome
to the Romans that they violated all precedent in appointing Marcus
Minucius, the master of the horse and an advocate of aggressive
tactics, as a second dictator. But when the latter risked an engagement,
he was badly beaten and only prompt assistance from Fabius
saved his army from destruction.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Cannae: 216 B. C.</hi> Next spring found the Romans and Carthaginians
facing each other in Apulia. The Romans were led by the
<pb n="82"/><anchor id="Pg82"/>new consuls, Lucius Aemilius Paulus and Gaius Terentius Varro.
The over-confidence of Varro led to the battle of Cannae, one of the
greatest battles of antiquity and the bloodiest of all Roman defeats.
Of 50,000 Romans and allies, about 25,000 were slain and 10,000
captured by the numerically inferior Carthaginians. The consequences
of the battle were serious. For the first time Rome’s allies
showed serious signs of disloyalty. In Apulia and in Bruttium Hannibal
found many adherents; ambassadors from Philip of Macedon
appeared at his headquarters, the prelude to an alliance in the next
year; Syracuse also, where Hiero the friend of Rome had just died,
wavered and finally went over to Carthage; and, most serious of all,
Capua opened its gates to Hannibal.
</p>

<p>
Still the courage of the Romans never wavered. They at once
levied a new force to replace the army destroyed at Cannae. The
central Italian allies, the Greek cities in the south, and the Latins,
remained true to their allegiance, and the fortified towns of the latter
proved to be the pillars of the Roman strength. For Hannibal,
owing to the smallness of his army and the necessity of maintaining
it in a hostile country, had to be continually on the march and could
not undertake siege operations, for which he also lacked engines of
war. Thus the Romans, avoiding pitched battles, were able to attempt
the systematic reduction of the towns which had yielded to Hannibal
and to hamper seriously the provisioning of his forces. At the
same time they still held command of the sea, kept up their offensive
in Spain, and held their ground against Carthaginian attacks in
Sicily and Sardinia.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Rome recovers Syracuse and Capua: 212–11 B. C.</hi> In 213 the
Romans were able to invest Syracuse. The Syracusans with the aid
of engines of war designed by the physicist Archimedes resisted desperately,
but Marcellus, the Roman general, pressed the siege vigorously,
and treachery caused the city to fall (212 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). Syracuse was
sacked, its art treasures carried off to Rome, and for the future it was
subject and tributary to Rome. And in Italy, although Hannibal defeated
and killed the consul Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, and was
able to occupy the cities of Tarentum (although not its citadel),
Heraclea and Thurii, he could not prevent the Romans from laying
siege to Capua (212 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). The next year he thought to force them
to raise the blockade by a sudden incursion into Latium, where he
appeared before the walls of Rome. But Rome was garrisoned, the
<pb n="83"/><anchor id="Pg83"/>army besieging Capua was not recalled, and Hannibal’s march was
in vain. Capua was starved into submission, its nobility put to the
sword, its territory confiscated, and its municipal organization dissolved.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Operations against Philip V. of Macedon.</hi> Upon concluding his
alliance with Hannibal, Philip of Macedon hastened to attack the
Roman possessions in Illyria. Here he met with some successes, but
failed to take Corcyra or Apollonia which were saved by the Roman
fleet. Furthermore, Rome’s command of the sea prevented his lending
any effective aid to his ally in Italy. Before long the Romans were
able to induce the Aetolians to make an alliance with them and attack
Macedonia. Thereupon other enemies of Philip, among them Sparta
and King Attalus of Pergamon, joined in the war on the side of
Rome. The Achaean Confederacy, however, supported Philip. The
coalition against the latter was so strong that he had to cease his attacks
upon Roman territory and Rome could be content with supporting
her Greek allies with a small fleet, while she devoted her
energies to the other theatres of war.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The war in Spain: 218–207 B. C.</hi> The fall of Capua came at a
moment most opportune for the Romans, since they had immediate
need to send reinforcements to Spain. Thither, as we have seen,
they had sent an army in 218 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> under Gnaeus Scipio, who obtained
a foothold north of the Ebro. In the next year he was joined
by his brother Publius Cornelius. Thereupon the Romans crossed
the Ebro and invaded the Carthaginian dominions to the south. A
revolt of the Numidians caused the recall of Hasdrubal to Africa,
and the Romans were able to capture Saguntum and induce many
Spanish tribes to desert the Carthaginian cause. However, upon the
return of Hasdrubal and the arrival of reinforcements from Carthage,
the Carthaginian commanders united their forces and crushed
the two Roman armies one after the other (211 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). Both the
Scipios fell in battle and the Carthaginians recovered all their territory
south of the Ebro.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Publius Cornelius Scipio sent to Spain: 210 B. C.</hi> Undismayed
by these disasters the Romans determined to continue their efforts
to conquer Spain because of its importance as a recruiting ground
for the Carthaginian armies and because the continuance of the war
there prevented reinforcements being sent to Hannibal in Italy. The
fall of Capua and the fortunate turn of events in Sicily enabled
<pb n="84"/><anchor id="Pg84"/>them to release fresh troops for service in Spain, and in 210 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>,
being dissatisfied with the cautious strategy of the pro-praetor Nero,
then commanding north of the Ebro, the Senate determined to send
out a commander who would continue the aggressive tactics of the
Scipios. As the most suitable person they fixed on Publius Cornelius
Scipio, son of the like-named consul who had fallen in 211. However,
he was only in his twenty-fourth year and having filled no
magistracy except the aedileship, he was technically disqualified from
exercising the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>. Therefore, his appointment was made the
subject of a special law in the Comitia, which nominated him to the
command in Spain with the rank of a pro-consul. This is the first
authentic instance of the conferment of the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> upon a private
citizen.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The capture of New Carthage: 209 B. C.</hi> Seeing that the armies
of his opponents were divided and engaged in reconquering the
Spanish tribes, Scipio resumed the offensive, crossed the Ebro, and
by a daring stroke seized the chief Carthaginian base—New Carthage.
Here he found vast stores of supplies and, more important
still, the hostages from the Spanish peoples subject to Carthage. His
liberation of these, and his generous treatment of the Spaniards in
general was in such striking contrast with the oppressive measures
of the Carthaginians, that he rapidly won over to his support both
the enemies and the adherents of the former.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Hasdrubal’s march to Italy: 208 B. C.</hi> Meanwhile in Italy
the Romans proceeded steadily with the reduction of the strongholds
in the hands of Hannibal. Tarentum was recovered in 210, and although
Hannibal defeated and slew the consuls Gnaeus Fulvius
(210) and Marcus Marcellus (208), his forces were so diminished
that his maintaining himself in Italy depended upon the arrival of
strong reinforcements. Since his arrival he had received but insignificant
additions to his army from Carthage, whose energies had been
directed to the other theatres of war. Up to this time also the Roman
activities in Spain had prevented any Carthaginian troops leaving
that country. But after the fall of New Carthage and the subsequent
successes of Scipio, Hasdrubal, despairing of the situation there,
determined to march to the support of his brother by the same route
which the latter had taken. Scipio endeavored to bar his path, but
although Hasdrubal was defeated in battle he and 10,000 of his men
cut their way through the Romans and crossed the Pyrenees (208 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>).
</p>

<pb n="85"/><anchor id="Pg85"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Metaurus: 207 B. C.</hi> The next spring he arrived among the
Gauls to the south of the Alps. Reinforced by them he marched into
the peninsula to join forces with Hannibal. For the Romans it was
of supreme importance to prevent this. They therefore divided their
forces; the consul Gaius Claudius faced Hannibal in Apulia, while
Marcus Livius went to intercept Hasdrubal. Through the capture
of messengers sent by the latter Claudius learned of his position and,
leaving part of his army to detain Hannibal, he withdrew the rest
without his enemy’s knowledge and joined his colleague Livius. Together
they attacked Hasdrubal at the Metaurus; his army was cut
to pieces and he himself was slain. With the battle the doom of
Hannibal’s plans was sealed, and with them the doom of Carthage.
Hannibal himself recognized that all was lost and withdrew into the
mountains of Bruttium.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The conquest of Carthaginian Spain, and peace with Philip.</hi>
For the first time in the war the Romans could breathe freely and
look forward with confidence to the issue. In the two years (207–206
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>) following the departure of Hasdrubal Scipio completed
the conquest of what remained to Carthage in Spain. In 205 he returned
to Rome to enter upon the consulship, and thereupon went to
Sicily to make preparations for the invasion of Africa, since the
Romans were now able to carry out their plan of 218 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> which
Hannibal had then interrupted. At this moment, too, the Romans
found themselves free from any embarrassment from the side of
Macedonia. In Greece the war had dragged on without any decided
advantage for either side until 207, when the temporary withdrawal
of the Roman fleet enabled Philip and the Achaean Confederacy to
win such successes that their opponents listened to the intervention
of the neutral states and made peace (206 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). In the next year
the Romans also came to terms with Philip.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The invasion of Africa: 204 B. C.</hi> In 204 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Scipio transported
his army to Africa. At first, however, he was able to do
nothing before the combined forces of the Carthaginians and the
Numidian chief, Syphax, who had renewed his alliance with them.
But in the following year he routed both armies so decisively that
he was able to capture and depose Syphax, and to set up in his place
a rival chieftain, Masinissa, whose adherence to the Romans brought
them a welcome superiority in cavalry. The <anchor id="corr085"/><corr sic="Cathaginians">Carthaginians</corr> now
sought to make peace. An armistice was granted them; Hannibal
<pb n="86"/><anchor id="Pg86"/>and all Carthaginian forces were recalled from Italy, and the preliminary
terms of peace drawn up (203 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). Hannibal left Italy
with the remnant of his veterans after a campaign which had established
his reputation as one of the world’s greatest masters of the
art of war. For nearly fifteen years he had maintained himself in
the enemy’s country with greatly inferior forces, and now after inflicting
many severe defeats and never losing a battle he was forced to
withdraw because of lack of resources, not because of the superior
generalship of his foes. Before leaving Italian soil he set up a record
of his exploits in the temple of Hera Lacinia in Bruttium.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Zama: 202 B. C.</hi> An almost incredible feeling of over-confidence
seems to have been aroused in Carthage by the arrival of Hannibal.
The Carthaginians broke the armistice by attacking some Roman
transports and refused to meet Scipio’s demand for an explanation.
Hostilities were therefore resumed. At Zama the two greatest generals
the war had developed met in its final battle. Hannibal’s tactics
were worthy of his reputation but his army was crushed by the flight
of the Carthaginian mercenaries at a critical moment, and by the
Roman superiority in cavalry<note place="foot">See Kromeyer und Veith, <hi rend="italic">Antike Schlachtfelder</hi>, iii. 2.</note>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Peace: 201 B. C.</hi> For Carthage all hope of resistance was over
and she had to accept the Roman terms. These were: the surrender
of all territory except the city of Carthage and the surrounding country
in Africa, an indemnity of 10,000 talents ($12,000,000), the surrender
of all vessels of war except ten triremes, and of all war elephants,
and the obligation to refrain from carrying on war outside
of Africa, or even in Africa unless with Rome’s consent. The Numidians
were united in a strong state on the Carthaginian borders,
under the Roman ally Masinissa. Scipio returned to Rome to triumph
<q>over the Carthaginians and Hannibal,</q> and to receive, from
the scene of his victory, the name of Africanus.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">V. The Effect of the Second Punic War upon Italy</hi></head>

<p>
The destruction of the Carthaginian empire left Rome mistress of
the western Mediterranean and by far the greatest power of the time.
But this victory had only been attained after a tremendous struggle,
the greatest probably that the ancient world ever witnessed, a struggle
<pb n="87"/><anchor id="Pg87"/>which called forth in Rome the patriotic virtues of courage, devotion,
and self-sacrifice to a degree that aroused the admiration of
subsequent generations, which drained her resources of men and
treasure and which left ineffaceable scars upon the soil of Italy.
</p>

<p>
One of the main factors in deciding the issue was the Roman command
of the sea which Carthage never felt able to challenge seriously.
Another was the larger citizen body of Rome, and the friendly relations
between herself and her federate allies. This, with the system
of universal military service, gave her a citizen soldiery which in
morale and numbers was superior to the armies of Carthage. As long
as Hannibal was in Italy Rome kept from year to year upwards of
100,000 men in the field. Once only, after the battle of Cannae, was
she unable to replace her losses by the regular system of recruiting
and had to arm 8000 slaves who were promised freedom as a reward
for faithful service. On the other hand, Carthage had to raise her
forces from mercenaries or from subject allies. As her resources
dwindled the former became ever more difficult to obtain, while the
demands made upon the latter caused revolts that cost much effort
to subdue. It required the personality of a Hannibal to develop an
<hi rend="italic">esprit de corps</hi> and discipline such as characterized his army in Italy.
A third factor was the absence in the Roman commanders of the
personal rivalries and lack of coöperation which so greatly hampered
the Carthaginians in Spain and in Sicily. Still one must not be led
into the error of supposing that the Carthaginians did not display
tenacity and patriotism to a very high degree. The senatorial class
especially distinguished itself by courage and ability, and there are
no evidences of factional strife hampering the conduct of the war.
The Romans overcame the disadvantage of the annual change of
commanders-in-chief by the use of the proconsulship and pro-praetorship
often long prorogued, whereby officers of ability retained year
after year the command of the same armies. This system enabled
them to develop such able generals as Metellus and the Scipios.
</p>

<p>
The cost of maintaining her fleet and her armies taxed the financial
resources of Rome to the utmost. The government had to make
use of a reserve fund which had been accumulating in the treasury
for thirty years from the returns of the 5% tax on the value of
manumitted slaves, and the armies in Spain could only be kept in
the field by the generosity and patriotism of several companies of
contractors who furnished supplies at their own expense until the end
<pb n="88"/><anchor id="Pg88"/>of the war. An additional burden was the increased cost of the necessities
of life and the danger of a grain famine, caused by the disturbed
conditions in Italy and Sicily and the withdrawal of so many
men from agricultural occupations. In 210 the situation was only
relieved by an urgent appeal to Ptolemy Philopator of Egypt, from
whom grain had to be purchased at three times the usual price. However,
this crisis passed with the pacification of Sicily in the next year.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, a heavy tribute had been levied upon the man power
of the Roman state. The census list of citizens eligible for military
service fell from about 280,000 at the beginning of the war to
237,000 in 209; and the federate allies must have suffered at least as
heavily. The greatest losses fell upon the southern part of the peninsula.
There, year after year, the fields had been laid waste and the
villages devastated by the opposing armies, until the rural population
had almost entirely disappeared, the land had become a wilderness,
and the more prosperous cities had fallen into decay. From the
effects of these ravages southern Italy never recovered.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The eastern crisis: 202 B. C.</hi> The Roman senate had been eager
to conclude a satisfactory peace with Carthage as soon as possible in
order to devote its undivided attention to a crisis which had arisen in
the eastern Mediterranean. There Ptolemy IV of Egypt had died
in 203 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, leaving the kingdom to an infant son who was in the
hands of corrupt and dissolute advisors. Egypt had lost her command
of the eastern Mediterranean at the time of Rome’s First Carthaginian
War, and later (217 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>) had only saved herself in a
war against Syria by calling to arms a portion of the native population.
This step had led to internal racial difficulties which weakened
the position of the dynasty. At this juncture Philip V of Macedon,
who had emerged with credit from his recent struggle with Rome and
his foes in Greece, and Antiochus III of Syria, who had just returned
from a series of successful campaigns (212–204 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>) which had
recovered for his kingdom its eastern provinces as far as the Indus
and had won for him the surname of <q>the Great,</q> judged the moment
favorable for the realization of long-cherished ambitions at the
expense of their rival, Egypt. They formed an alliance for the conquest
of the outlying possessions of the Ptolemies, whereby Philip was
to occupy those in the Aegean, while Antiochus was to <anchor id="corr089"/><corr sic="sieze">seize</corr> Phoenicia
and Palestine. In 202 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> they opened hostilities.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The appeal for Roman intervention: 201 B. C.</hi> But the operations
of the forces of Philip in the Aegean brought him into war with
Rhodes and with Attalus, King of Pergamon, while in Greece a quarrel,
which developed between some of his allies and the Athenians,
involved him in hostilities with the latter. From these three states
<pb n="90"/><anchor id="Pg90"/>and from Egypt, which, having been unable to prevent Antiochus
from occupying her Syrian possessions, was now threatened with invasion,
envoys were sent to Rome, to request Roman intervention
on their behalf, on the ground that they were friends (<hi rend="italic">amici</hi>) of
Rome.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The status of amicitia.</hi> The Romans had adopted the idea of
international friendship (<hi rend="italic">amicitia</hi>, <hi rend="italic">philia</hi>) from the Greeks in the
course of the third century. Previously, their only conception of
friendly relations between states was that of alliance (<hi rend="italic">societas</hi>) based
upon a perpetual treaty (<hi rend="italic">foedus</hi>), which bound each party to render
military assistance to the other and which neither could terminate at
discretion. However, under the influence of ideas current among the
Hellenic states they began to form friendships, i. e. to open up diplomatic
relations with states and rulers. These <hi rend="italic">amici</hi> (friends) could
remain neutral in case Rome engaged in war, or they could render
Rome support, which was, however, voluntary and not obligatory.
And Rome enjoyed a similar freedom of action with regard to them.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Rome intervenes: 200 B. C.</hi> The Roman Senate, influenced by
mixed motives—sympathy for the Hellenes and their culture, ambition
to appear as arbiters of the fate of the Greek world, a desire
for revenge upon Philip for his partial successes in the late war, and
fear of seeing him develop into a more powerful enemy—was anxious
to intervene. But, although the Roman fetials, the members of the
priestly college which was the guardian of the Roman traditions in
international relations, decided that Attalus and the other Roman
<hi rend="italic">amici</hi> might be regarded as allies (<hi rend="italic">socii</hi>) and so be defended legitimately,
the Roman people as a whole shrank from embarking upon
another war. The Comitia once voted against the proposal, and at
a second meeting was only induced to sanction it, when it was represented
to them that they would have to face another invasion of
Italy if they did not anticipate Philip’s action.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Roman ultimatum.</hi> The Senate next sent ambassadors to
the East to present an ultimatum to Philip, and at the same time to
negotiate with Antiochus for the cessation of his attacks upon Egypt,
for the Romans did not wish to have his forces added to those of the
Macedonian king. When Philip was engaged in the siege of Abydos
on the Hellespont he received the Roman terms, which were that he
should abstain from attacking any cities of the Greeks or the possessions
of Ptolemy, and should submit to arbitration his disputes with
<pb n="91"/><anchor id="Pg91"/>Attalus and the Rhodians. Upon his rejection of these proposals the
war opened.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Romans cross the Adriatic.</hi> Late in 200 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> a Roman
army under the consul Sulpicius crossed into Illyricum and endeavored
to penetrate into Macedonia. However, both in this and in the
succeeding year, the Romans, although aided by the forces of the
Aetolian Confederacy, Pergamon, Rhodes and Athens, were unable
to inflict any decisive defeat upon Philip or to invade his kingdom.
</p>

<p>
However, with the arrival of the consul of 198, Titus Flamininus,
the situation speedily changed. The Achaean Confederacy was won
over to the side of Rome, and Flamininus succeeded in forcing Philip
to evacuate his position in Epirus and to withdraw into Thessaly.
In the following winter negotiations for peace were opened, but these
led to nothing, for the Romans demanded the evacuation of Corinth,
Chalcis and Demetrias, three fortresses known as <q>the fetters of
Greece,</q> and Philip refused to make this concession.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Cynoscephalae: 197 B. C.</hi> The next year military operations
were resumed with both armies in Thessaly. Early in the summer
a battle was fought on a ridge of hills called Cynoscephalae (the
Dog’s Heads) where the Romans won a complete victory. Although
the Aetolians tendered valuable assistance in this engagement, the
Macedonian defeat was due to the superior flexibility of the Roman
legionary formation over the phalanx. Philip fled to Macedonia and
sued for peace. The Aetolians and his enemies in Greece sought his
utter destruction, but Flamininus realized the importance of Macedonia
to the Greek world as a bulwark against the Celtic peoples
of the lower Danube and would not support their demands. The
terms fixed by the Roman Senate were: the autonomy of the Hellenes,
the evacuation of the Macedonian possessions in Greece, in the
Aegean, and in Illyricum, and an indemnity of 1000 talents
($1,200,000). The conditions Philip was obliged to accept (196
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The proclamation of Flamininus: 196 B. C.</hi> At the Isthmian
games of the same year Flamininus proclaimed the complete autonomy
of the peoples who had been subject to Macedonia. The announcement
provoked a tremendous outburst of enthusiasm. After
spending some time in carrying this proclamation into effect and in
settling the claims of various states, Flamininus returned to Italy in
194, leaving the Greeks to make what use they could of their freedom.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. The War with Antiochus the Great and the Aetolians:
192–189 b. c.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Antiochus in Asia Minor and Thrace.</hi> Even before Flamininus
and his army had withdrawn from Greece the activities of Antiochus
had awakened the mistrust of the Roman Senate and threatened to
lead to hostilities. The Syrian king had completed the conquest of
Lower Syria in 198, and then, profiting by the difficulties in which
Philip of Macedon was involved, he turned his attention towards
Asia Minor and Thrace with the hope of recovering the possessions
once held by his ancestor, Seleucus I, in these quarters. The Romans
were at the time too much occupied to oppose him, and, outwardly,
he professed to be the friend of Rome and to be limiting his
activities to the reëstablishing of his empire to its former extent.
Eventually, in 195 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, he crossed over into Europe and proceeded
to establish himself in Thrace. Negotiations with the Roman Senate
seemed likely to lead to an agreement that the king should limit his
expansion to Asia and recognize a sort of Roman suzerainty in Europe,
when the action of the Aetolians precipitated a conflict.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Aetolians and Rome.</hi> The Aetolians, who had been Rome’s
allies in the war just concluded and who greatly exaggerated the importance
of their services, were disgruntled because the kingdom of
Macedonia had not been entirely dismembered and they had been
restrained from enlarging the territory of the Confederacy at the expense
of their neighbors. In short, they wished to take the place formerly
held by Macedonia among the Greek states. Accustomed to
regard war as a legitimate source of revenue, they did not easily
reconcile themselves to Rome’s preservation of peace in Hellas. Ever
since the battle of Cynoscephalae they had striven to undermine Roman
influence among the Greeks, and now they sought to draw Antiochus
into conflict with Rome.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Antiochus invades Greece: 192 B. C.</hi> In 192 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> they elected
Antiochus as commander-in-chief of the forces of their confederacy
and seized the fortress of Chalcis. This they offered to the king,
to whom they also made an unauthorized promise of aid from Macedonia.
Thereupon, trusting in the support promised by the Aetolians,
Antiochus sailed to Greece with a small force of 10,000 men. It so
happened that Hannibal, who in 196 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> had been forced to flee
<pb n="93"/><anchor id="Pg93"/>his native city owing to the machinations of his enemies and the
Romans, was then at the court of Antiochus, where he had taken
refuge. He advised his protector to invade the Italian peninsula,
but Antiochus rejected the advice, probably with wisdom, for such a
course would have required him to win the control of the sea, which
was a task beyond his resources. But when, throughout his whole
campaign, he neglected to make use of the services of the greatest
commander of the age, he committed a most serious blunder. Had
Hannibal led the forces of Antiochus the task of the Romans would
not have been so simple.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Antiochus driven from Greece: 191 B. C.</hi> In 191 a Roman
army under the consul Acilius Glabrio appeared in Greece and attacked
and defeated the forces of Antiochus at Thermopylae. The
king fled to Asia. Contrary to his hopes he had found but little
support in Greece. Philip of Macedon and the Achaean Confederacy
adhered to the Romans, and the Aetolians were rendered helpless by
an invasion of their own country. Furthermore, the Rhodians and
Eumenes, the new King of Pergamon, joined their navies to the
Roman fleet.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Romans cross over to Asia Minor: 190 B. C.</hi> As Antiochus
would not hearken to the terms of peace laid down by the Romans,
the latter resolved upon the invasion of Asia Minor. Two naval
battles, won by the aid of Rhodes and Pergamon, secured the control
of the Aegean and in 190 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> a Roman force crossed the Hellespont.
For its commander the Senate had wished to designate Scipio Africanus,
the greatest of the Roman generals. However, as he had recently
been consul he was now ineligible for that office. The obstacle
of the law was accordingly circumvented by the election of his brother
Lucius to the consulate and his assignment to this command, and by
the appointment of Publius to accompany him as extraordinary proconsul,
with power equal to his own.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Magnesia: 190 B. C.</hi> One decisive victory over Antiochus at
Magnesia in the autumn of 190 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> brought him to terms. He
agreed to surrender all territory to the north of the Taurus mountains
and west of Pamphylia, to give up his war elephants, to surrender all
but ten of his ships of war, to pay an indemnity of 15,000 talents
($18,000,000) in twelve annual instalments, and to abstain from attacking
the allies of Rome. Still, unlike Carthage, he was at liberty
to defend himself if attacked. The Romans then proceeded to
estab<pb n="94"/><anchor id="Pg94"/>lish order in Asia Minor. The territories of their friends, Rhodes
and Pergamon, were materially increased, while the enemies of the
latter, the Celts of Galatia were defeated and <anchor id="corr094"/><corr sic="forcd">forced</corr> to pay a heavy
indemnity. Rome retained no territory in Asia, but left the country
divided among a number of small states whose mutual jealousies rendered
impossible the rise of a strong power which could venture to
set aside the Roman arrangements.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The subjugation of the Aetolians: 189 B. C.</hi> The Roman campaign
of 191 against the Aetolians had caused the latter, who were
also attacked by Philip of Macedon, to seek terms. However, as
the Romans demanded an unconditional surrender, the Aetolians decided
to continue the struggle. In the next year no energetic measures
were taken against them, but in 189 the consul Fulvius Nobilior
pressed the war vigorously and besieged their chief city, Ambracia.
But since the obstinate resistance of its defenders defied all his efforts,
and since the Athenians were trying to act as mediators in bringing
the war to a close, the Romans abandoned their demand for an unconditional
surrender and peace was made on the following conditions.
The Aetolian Confederacy gave up all territory captured by its enemies
during the war and entered into a permanent alliance with Rome,
whereby it was bound to send contingents to the Roman armies.
Ambracia was surrendered and destroyed, and the Romans occupied
the pirate nest of Cephallenia.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Rome and the Greek states.</hi> Although by her alliance with the
Aetolians Rome had planted herself permanently on Greek soil, and
in the war with Antiochus had claimed to exercise a sort of protectorate
over the Greek world, still the Senate as yet gave no indication
of reversing the policy of Flamininus, and the Greek states
remained as the friends of Rome in the enjoyment of political independence.
However, it was not long before these friendly relations
became seriously strained and Rome was induced to embark upon a
policy of interference in Greek affairs which ultimately put an end
to the apparent freedom of Hellas. The fundamental cause of this
change was that while Rome interpreted Greek freedom to mean
liberty of action provided that the wishes and arrangements of Rome
were respected, the Greeks understood it to mean the perfect freedom
<pb n="95"/><anchor id="Pg95"/>of sovereign communities, and resented bitterly any infringement
of their rights. Keeping in mind these conflicting points of view, it
is easy to see how difficulties were bound to arise which would inevitably
be settled according to the wishes of the stronger power.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Rome and the Achaeans.</hi> The chief specific causes for the
change in the Roman policy are to be found in the troubles of the
Achaean Confederacy and the reviving ambitions of Macedonia. The
Confederacy included many city-states which had been compelled to
join it and which sought to regain their independence. This the
Confederacy was determined to prevent. One such community was
Sparta, and the policy of the Achaeans towards it in the matter of the
restoration of Spartan exiles led to the Spartans appealing to Rome.
The Roman decision wounded the susceptibilities of the Confederacy
without settling the problem, and the tendency of the Achaeans to
stand upon their rights provoked the anger of the Romans. Within
the Confederacy there developed a pro-Roman party ready to submit
to Roman dictatorship, and a national party determined to assert
their right to freedom of action. From 180 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the Romans deliberately
fostered the aristocratic factions throughout the cities of Greece,
feeling that they were the more stable element and more in harmony
with the policy of the Senate. As a consequence the democratic factions
began to look for outside support and cast their eyes towards
Macedonia.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Rome and Macedonia.</hi> Philip V of Macedon considered that
the assistance which he had furnished to Rome in the Syrian War
was proof of his loyalty and warranted the annexation of the territory
he had overrun in that conflict. But the Senate was not inclined
to allow the power of Macedonia to attain dangerous proportions,
and he was forced to forego his claims. Henceforth he was
the bitter foe of the Romans. He devoted himself to the development
of the military resources of his kingdom with the ultimate view of
again challenging Rome’s authority in Greece. At his death in 179
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he left an army of from 30,000 to 40,000 men and a treasure
of 6,000 talents ($7,200,000). His son and successor Perseus inherited
his father’s anti-Roman policy and entered into relations with
the foes of Rome everywhere in Greece.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Third Macedonian War: 171–167 B. C.</hi> But the Senate
was kept well aware of his schemes by his enemies in Greece, especially
Eumenes of Pergamon. Therefore they determined to forestall
<pb n="96"/><anchor id="Pg96"/>the completion of his plans and force him into war. In 172, a Roman
commission visited Perseus and required of him concessions which
meant the extinction of his independence. Upon his refusal to comply
with the demands they returned home and Rome declared war.
Now, when success depended upon energetic action, Perseus sought to
avoid the issue and tried to placate the Romans, but in vain. In 171
a Roman force landed in Greece and made its way to Thessaly. But
in the campaigns of this and the following year the Roman commanders
were too incapable and their troops too undisciplined to make any
headway. Nor did Perseus show ability to take advantage of his
opportunities. Furthermore, by his parsimony he lost the chance to
win valuable aid from the Dardanians, Gesatae, and Celts on his
borders. Finally, in 168, the Romans found an able general in the
consul Aemilius Paulus, who restored the morale of the Roman soldiers
and won a complete victory over Perseus in the battle of Pydna.
The Macedonian kingdom was at an end; its territory was divided
into four autonomous republics, which were forbidden mutual privileges
of <hi rend="italic">commercium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">connubium</hi>; a yearly tribute of fifty talents
was imposed upon them; and the royal mines and domains became
the property of the Roman state.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The aftermath of the war.</hi> Having disposed of Macedon the
Romans turned their attention to the other Greek states with the intention
of rewarding their friends and punishing their enemies.
Everywhere death or exile awaited the leaders of the anti-Roman party,
many of whose names became known from the seizure of the papers
of Perseus. Although the Achaeans had given no positive proof of
disloyalty 1000 of their leading men, among them the historian Polybius,
were carried off to Italy nominally to be given the chance of
clearing themselves before the Senate but really to be kept as hostages
in Italy for the future conduct of the Confederacy.
</p>

<p>
The Rhodians, because they had endeavored to secure a peaceful
settlement between Rome and Perseus, were forced to surrender their
possessions in Asia Minor, and a ruinous blow was dealt to their
commercial prosperity by the establishment of a free port at the island
of Delos. Eumenes of Pergamon, whose actions had aroused suspicions,
had to recognize the independence of the Galatians whom he
had subdued. Far worse was the fate of Epirus. There seventy
towns were sacked and their inhabitants to the number of 150,000
carried off into slavery.
</p>

<pb n="97"/><anchor id="Pg97"/>

<p>
Henceforth it was clear that Rome was the real sovereign in the
eastern Mediterranean and that her friends and allies only enjoyed
local autonomy, while they were expected to be obedient to the orders
of Rome. This is well illustrated by the anecdote of the circle of
Popilius. During the Third Macedonian War, Antiochus IV,
Epiphanes, King of Syria, had invaded Egypt. After the battle of
Pydna a Roman ambassador, Popilius by name, was sent to make
him withdraw. Popilius met Antiochus before Alexandria and delivered
the Senate’s message. The king asked for time for consideration,
but the Roman, drawing a circle around him in the sand, bade
him answer before he left the spot. Antiochus yielded and evacuated
Egypt.
</p>

<p>
The spoils of this war with Macedonia brought an enormous booty
into the Roman treasury, and from this time the war tax on property—the
<hi rend="italic">tributum civium Romanorum</hi>—ceased to be levied. The income
of the empire enabled the government to relieve Roman citizens
of all direct taxation.

<p>
During the Macedonian and Syrian Wars the Romans were busy
strengthening and extending their hold upon northern Italy and
Spain.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Cisalpine Gaul.</hi> Cisalpine Gaul, which had been largely lost to
the Romans since Hannibal’s invasion, was recovered by wars with
the Insubres and Boii between 198 and 191 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> A new military
highway, the <hi rend="italic">via Flaminia</hi>, was built from Rome to Ariminum in 187,
and later extended under the name of the <hi rend="italic">via Aemilia</hi> to Placentia;
another, the <hi rend="italic">via Cassia</hi> (171 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>), linked Rome and the Po valley
by way of Etruria. New fortresses were established; Bononia (189)
and Aquileia (181) as Latin colonies; <anchor id="corr097"/><corr sic="Perma">Parma</corr> and Mutina (183) as
colonies of Roman citizens. In this way Roman authority was firmly
established and the way prepared for the rapid Latinization of the
land between the Apennines and the Alps.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Ligurians.</hi> In the same period falls the subjugation of the
Ligurians. In successive campaigns, lasting until 172 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, the
Romans gradually extended their sway over the various Ligurian
tribes until they reached the territory of Massalia in southern Gaul.
Roman colonies were founded at Pisa (180) and Luna (177).
</p>

<pb n="98"/><anchor id="Pg98"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Spain.</hi> The territory acquired from Carthage in Spain was organized
into two provinces, called Hither and Farther Spain, in 197 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
But the allied and subject Spanish tribes were not yet reconciled to
the presence of the Romans and serious revolts broke out. One of
these was subdued by Marcus Porcius Cato in 196, another by Lucius
Aemilius Paulus between 191 and 189, and a third by Tiberius
Sempronius Gracchus in 179 and 178 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> The settlement effected
by Gracchus secured peace for many years. In Spain were founded
Rome’s first colonies beyond the borders of Italy. Italica, near
Seville, was settled in 206, and Carteia in 171; both as Latin colonies.

<head>TERRITORIAL EXPANSION IN THREE CONTINENTS:
167–133 B. C.</head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Roman foreign policy.</hi> The foreign relations of Rome from 167
to 133 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> fall into two distinct periods. In the earlier, Roman
foreign policy is directed towards securing Roman domination
throughout the Mediterranean by diplomatic means. War and annexation
of territory are avoided as causing too great a drain upon
the resources of the state and creating difficult administrative problems.
In the later period this policy is abandoned for one more
aggressively imperialistic, which does not hesitate to appeal to armed
force and aims at the incorporation of conquered territory within the
empire. This change of policy was largely due to the influence of
that group in the senate which was eager for foreign commands, the
honors of a triumph, and the spoils of war, as well as that of the
non-senatorial financial interests which sought to open up new fields
for exploitation. It was also felt that the prestige of Rome had suffered
by the disregard of some of her diplomatic representations.
</p>

<p>
This policy of expansion resulted in prolonged wars in Spain, the
annexation of Carthage and Macedon, the establishment of direct control
over Greece, and the acquisition of territory in Asia Minor. The
new tendencies become apparent shortly before 150 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The revolts of the Celtiberians and the Lusitanians: 154–139
B. C.</hi> In 154 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> revolts broke out in both Hither and Farther
Spain. A series of long and bloody campaigns ensued, which were
prolonged by the incapacity, cruelty and faithlessness of the Roman
commanders, and caused a heavy drain upon the military resources
of Italy. The chief opponents of the Romans were the Celtiberians
of Hither, and the Lusitanians of Farther Spain. The desperate
character of these wars made service in Spain very unpopular, and
<pb n="100"/><anchor id="Pg100"/>levies for the campaign of 151 were raised with difficulty. The tribunes
interceded to protect certain persons, and when their intercession
was disregarded by the consuls they cast the latter into prison. In
150 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the pro-consul Galba treacherously massacred thousands of
Lusitanians with whom he had made a treaty. For this he was
brought to trial by Cato, but was acquitted.
</p>

<p>
The massacre led to a renewed outbreak under Viriathus, an able
guerilla leader who defied the power of Rome for about eight years
(147–139 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). Forced eventually to yield, he was assassinated
during an armistice by traitors suborned by the Roman commander.
The complete subjugation of the Lusitanians soon followed.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The war with Numantia: 143–133 B. C.</hi> Meantime, after an
interval of some years, in 143 the war had broken out afresh in the
nearer province where the struggle centered about the town of Numantia.
In 140 the Roman general Pompeius made peace upon easy
terms with the Numantines, but later repudiated it, and the Senate
ignored his arrangements. Again in 138 the tribunes interfered with
the levy, so great was the popular aversion to service in Spain. The
next year witnessed the disgraceful surrender of the consul Mancinus
and his army, comprising 20,000 Romans, to the Numantines. By
concluding a treaty he saved the lives of his army. But the Roman
Senate perfidiously rejected the sworn agreement of the consul, made
him the scapegoat and delivered him bound to the Numantines, who

<p>
At length, weary of defeats, the Romans re-elected to the consulship
for 134 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> their tried general Scipio Aemilianus, the conqueror
of Carthage, and appointed him as commander in Spain. His first
task was to restore the discipline in his army. Then he opened the
blockade of Numantia. After a siege of fifteen months the city was
starved into submission and completely destroyed. A commission
of ten senators reorganized the country and Spain entered upon a
long era of peace.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Third Punic War: 149–146 B. C. Its causes.</hi> The treaty
which ended the Second Punic War had forbidden the Carthaginians
the right to make war outside of Africa, or within it without the
consent of Rome. At the same time their enemy Masinissa had been
<pb n="101"/><anchor id="Pg101"/>established as a powerful prince on their borders. In such a situation
future Roman intervention was inevitable. But for a generation
Carthage was left in peace. A pro-Roman party was in control there
and bent all its energies to the peaceful revival of Carthaginian commerce.
And the Romans, after a period of suspicion which ended
with the exile of Hannibal in 196, regarded Carthaginian prosperity
without enmity. However, this prosperity in the end led to the ruin
of the city, for it awakened the envy of the Senate and the financial
interests of Rome, which became only too ready to seize upon any
excuse for the destruction of their ancient rival.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Cato and Carthage.</hi> The opportunity came through the action of
Masinissa. This chieftain, knowing the restrictions imposed upon
Carthage by her treaty with Rome, and sensing the change in the
Roman attitude towards that city after 167 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, revived old claims to
Carthaginian territory. Carthage could only appeal to Rome for
protection, but in 161 and 157 the Roman commissions sent to adjust
the disputes decided in favor of Masinissa. A member of the commission
of 157 was the old Marcus Porcius Cato, who was still
obsessed with the fear which Carthage had inspired in his youth, and
who returned from his mission filled with alarm at the wealth of the
city and henceforth devoted all his energies to accomplish its overthrow.
In the following years he concluded all his speeches in the
Senate with the words, <q>Carthage must be destroyed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Roman ultimatum: 149 B. C.</hi> A fresh attack by Masinissa
occurred in 151 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Enraged, the Carthaginians took the field
against him, but suffered defeat. The Romans at once prepared for
war. Conscious of having overstepped their rights and fearful of
Roman vengeance, the Carthaginians offered unconditional submission
in the hope of obtaining pardon. The Senate assured them of
their lives, property and constitution, but required hostages and bade
them execute the commands of the consuls who crossed over to Africa
with an army and ordered the Carthaginians to surrender their arms
and engines of war. The Carthaginians, desirous of appeasing the
Romans at all costs, complied. Then came the ultimatum. They
must abandon their city and settle at least ten miles from the sea
coast. This was practically a death sentence to the ancient mercantile
city. Seized with the fury of despair the Carthaginians improvised
weapons and, manning their walls, bade defiance to the
Romans.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The siege of Carthage: 149–146 B. C.</hi> For two years the Romans,
owing to the incapacity of their commanders, accomplished
little. Then disappointment and apprehension led the Roman people
to demand as consul Scipio Aemilianus, who had already distinguished
himself as a military tribune. He was only a candidate for
the aedileship and legally ineligible for the consulate. But the restrictions
upon his candidature were suspended, and he was elected
consul for 147 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> A special law entrusted him with the conduct
of the war in Africa. He restored discipline in the Roman army,
defeated the Carthaginians in the field and energetically pressed the
siege of the city. The Carthaginians suffered frightfully from hunger
and their forces were greatly reduced. In the spring of 146 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
the Romans forced their way into the city and captured it after desperate
fighting in the streets and houses. The handful of survivors
were sold into slavery, their city levelled to the ground and its site
declared accursed. Out of the Carthaginian territory the Romans
created a new province, called Africa. The last act in the dramatic
struggle between the two cities was ended.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Fourth Macedonian War: 149–148 B. C.</hi> The mutual rivalries
among the Greek states, which frequently evoked senatorial intervention,
and the ill-will occasioned by the harshness of the Romans
towards the anti-Roman party everywhere, caused a large faction
among the Hellenes to be ready to seize the first favorable opportunity
for freeing Greece from Roman suzerainty.
</p>

<p>
Relying upon this antagonism to Rome, a certain Andriscus, who
claimed to be a son of Perseus, appeared in Macedonia in 149 and
claimed the throne. He made himself master of the country and defeated
the first Roman forces sent against him. However, he was
crushed in the following year at Pydna by the praetor Metellus, and
Macedonia was recovered. The four republics were not restored but
the whole country was organized as a Roman province (148 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Achaeans assert their independence.</hi> The Achaean Confederacy
was one of the states where the feeling against Rome ran
especially high. There the irksomeness of the Roman protectorate
was heightened by the return of the survivors of the political exiles
<pb n="103"/><anchor id="Pg103"/>of 167, 300 in number. The anti-Roman party, supported by the
extreme democratic elements in the cities, was in control of the Confederacy
when border difficulties with Sparta broke out afresh in
149 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> The matter was referred to the Senate for settlement, but
the Achaeans did not await its decision. They attacked and defeated
Sparta, confident that the hands of the Romans were tied by the wars
in Spain, Africa and Macedonia.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The dissolution of the Confederacy: 146 B. C.</hi> The Roman
Senate determined to punish the Confederacy by detaching certain important
cities from its membership. But in 147 the Achaean assembly
tempestuously refused to carry out the orders of the Roman ambassadors,
in spite of the fact that the Macedonian revolt had been
crushed. Their leaders, expecting no mercy from Rome, prepared
for war and they were joined by the Boeotians and other peoples of
central Greece. The next year they resolved to attack Sparta, whereupon
the Romans sent a fleet and an army against them under the
consul Lucius Mummius. Metellus, the conqueror of Macedonia,
subdued central Greece and Mummius routed the forces of the Confederacy
at Leucopetra on the Isthmus (146 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). Corinth was
sacked and burnt; its treasures were carried off to Rome; and its inhabitants
sold into slavery. Its land, like that of Carthage, was
added to the Roman public domain. Like Alexander’s destruction
of Thebes this was a warning which the other cities of Greece could
not misinterpret. A senatorial commission dissolved the Achaean
Confederacy as well as the similar political combinations of the Boeotians
and Phocians, The cities of Greece entered into individual
relations with Rome. Those which had stood on the side of Rome, as
Athens and Sparta, retained their previous status as Roman allies; the
rest were made subject and tributary. Greece was not organized as
a province, but was put under the supervision of the governor of
Macedonia.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The province of Asia.</hi> In 133 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> died Attalus III, King of
Pergamon, the last of his line. In his will he made the Roman people
the heir to his kingdom, probably with the feeling that otherwise
disputes over the succession would end in Roman interference and
conquest. The Romans accepted the inheritance but before they took
<pb n="104"/><anchor id="Pg104"/>possession a claimant appeared in the person of an illegitimate son
of Eumenes II, one Aristonicus. He occupied part of the kingdom,
defeated and killed the consul Crassus in 131, but was himself beaten
and captured by the latter’s successor Perpena in <anchor id="corr104"/><corr sic="129">129.</corr>
</p>

<p>
Out of the kingdom of Pergamon there was then formed the Roman
province of Asia (129 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). The occupation of this country
made Rome mistress of both shores of the Aegean and gave her a convenient
bridgehead for an advance further eastward. The question
of the financial administration of Asia and its relation to Roman
politics will be discussed in a subsequent chapter.

<head>THE ROMAN STATE AND THE EMPIRE: 265–133 B. C.</head>

<p>
The conquest of the hegemony of the Mediterranean world entailed
the most serious consequences for the Roman state itself. Indeed,
the wars which form the subject of the preceding chapters were the
ultimate cause of the crisis that led to the fall of the Roman Republic.
In the present chapter it will be our task to trace the changes and indicate
the problems that had their origin in these wars and the ensuing
conquests. Such a survey is best begun by considering the
character of the Roman government during the epoch in question.

<index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="I. The Rule of the Senatorial Aristocracy"/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">I. The Rule of the Senatorial Aristocracy</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Senate’s control over the magistrates, tribunate, and
assemblies.</hi> From the passing of the Hortensian Law in 287 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
to the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus in 133 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the Senate exercised
a practically unchallenged control over the policy of the Roman state.
For the Senate was able to guide or nullify the actions of the magistrates,
the tribunate, and the assemblies; a condition made possible
by the composition of the Senate, which, in addition to the ex-magistrates,
included all those above the rank of quaestor actually in office,
and by the peculiar organization and limitations of the Roman popular
assemblies.
</p>

<p>
The higher magistrates were simply committees of senators elected
by the assemblies. Their interests were those of the Senate as a
whole, and constitutional practice required them to seek its advice
upon all matters of importance. The Senate assigned to the consuls
and praetors their spheres of duty, appointed pro-magistrates and
allotted them their commands, and no contracts let by the censors were
valid unless approved by the Senate. Except when the consuls were
in the city, the Senate controlled all expenditures from the public
treasury.
</p>

<p>
The chief weapon of the tribunes, their right of veto, which had
<pb n="106"/><anchor id="Pg106"/>been instituted as a check upon the power of the Senate and the magistrates,
became an instrument whereby the Senate bridled the tribunate
itself. For, since after 287 the plebeians speedily came to constitute
a majority in the senate chamber, it was not difficult for this body to
secure the veto of the tribunes upon any measures of which it disapproved,
whether they originated with a consul or a tribune.
</p>

<p>
And, because the popular assemblies could only vote upon such
measures or for such candidates as were submitted to them by the presiding
magistrates, the Senate through its influence over magistrates
and tribunes controlled both the legislative and elective activities of
the comitia.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Senate and the public policy.</hi> Since the Senate was a permanent
body, easily assembled and regularly summoned by the consuls
to discuss all matters of public concern, it was natural that the
foreign policy of the state should be entirely in its hands—subject,
of course, to the right of the Assembly of the Centuries to sanction
the making of war or peace—and hence the organization and government
of Rome’s foreign possessions became a senatorial prerogative.
And, likewise, it fell to the Senate to deal with all sudden crises which
constituted a menace to the welfare of the state, like the spread of the
Bacchanalian associations which was ended by the <hi rend="italic">Senatus Consultum</hi>
of 186 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> And, finally, the Senate claimed the right to proclaim
a state of martial law by passing the so-called <hi rend="italic">Senatus Consultum
ultimum</hi>, a decree which authorized the magistrates to use any means
whatsoever to preserve the state.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Polybius and the Roman Constitution.</hi> Thus in spite of the
fact that the Greek historian and statesman, Polybius, who was an
intimate of the governing circles in Rome about the middle of the
second century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, in looking at the form of the Roman constitution
could call it a nice balance between monarchy, represented by the consuls,
aristocracy, represented by the Senate, and democracy, represented
by the tribunate and assemblies, in actual practice the state
was governed by the Senate. It is true that the Senate was not always
absolute master of the situation. Between 233 and 217 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, the
popular leader Caius Flaminius, as tribune, consul and censor, was
able to carry out a democratic policy at variance with the Senate’s
wishes, but with his death the control of the Senate became firmer than
ever. From what has been said it will readily be seen that the Senate’s
power rested mainly upon custom and precedent and upon the
<pb n="107"/><anchor id="Pg107"/>prestige and influence of itself as a whole and its individual members,
not upon powers guaranteed by law. The Roman republic never
was a true democracy, but was strongly aristocratic in character.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The aristocracy of office.</hi> The Senate was representative of a
narrow circle of wealthy patrician and plebeian families, which constituted
the new nobility that came into being with the cessation of
the patricio-plebeian struggle and which was in truth an office-holding
aristocracy. For, after the initial widening of the circle of families
enobled by admission to the Senate, the third century saw these create
for themselves a real, if not legal, monopoly of the magistracies and
thus of the regular gateway to the senate chamber. This they could
do because the expense involved in holding public offices, which were
without salary, and in conducting the election campaigns, which became
increasingly costly as time went on, deterred all but persons of
considerable fortune from seeking office, and because the exercise of
personal influence and the right of the officer conducting an election
to reject the candidature of a person of whom he disapproved, made it
possible to prevent in most cases the election of any one not <hi rend="italic">persona
grata</hi> to the majority of the senators. It was only individuals of
exceptional force and ability, like Cato the Elder, and in later times
Marius and Cicero, who could penetrate the barriers thus established.
Such a person was signalled as a <hi rend="italic">novus homo</hi>, a <q>new-comer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The goal of office.</hi> While Rome was hard-pressed by her enemies
and while the issue of the struggle for world empire was still in
doubt, the Senate displayed to a remarkable degree the qualities of
self-sacrifice and steadfastness which so largely contributed to Rome’s
ultimate triumph, as well as great political adroitness in the foreign
relations of the state. But with the passing of all external dangers,
personal ambition and class interest became more and more evident to
the detriment of its patriotism and prestige. Office-holding, with the
opportunities it offered for ruling over subject peoples and of commanding
in profitable wars, became a ready means for securing for
oneself and one’s friends the wealth which was needed to maintain
the new standard of luxurious living now affected by the ruling class
of the imperial city. The higher magistracies were rendered still more
valuable in the eyes of the senators when the latter were prohibited
from participating directly in commercial ventures outside of Italy
by a law passed in 219 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, which forbade senators to own ships of
seagoing capacity, with the object probably of preventing the foreign
<pb n="108"/><anchor id="Pg108"/>policy of the state from being directed by commercial interests. As
a consequence the rivalry for office became extremely keen, and the
customary canvassing for votes tended to degenerate into bribery both
of individuals and of the voting masses. In the latter case it took
the form of entertaining the public by the elaborate exhibition of
lavish spectacles in the theatre and the arena.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Attempts to restrain abuses.</hi> However, the sense of responsibility
was still strong enough in the Senate as a whole to secure the
passing of legislation designed to check this evil. The Villian law
(<hi rend="italic">lex Villia annalis</hi>) of 180 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> established a regular sequence for
the holding of the magistracies. Henceforth the quaestorship had to
be held before the praetorship, and the latter before the consulate.
The aedileship was not made imperative, but was regularly sought
after the quaestorship, because it involved the supervision of the public
games and festivals, and in this way gave a good opportunity for
ingratiating oneself with the populace. The tribunate was not considered
as one of the regular magistracies, and the censorship, according
to the custom previously established, followed the consulship.
The minimum age of twenty-eight years was set for the holding of
the quaestorship, and an interval of two years was required between
successive magistracies. Somewhat later, about 151 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, re-elections
to the same office were forbidden. In the years 181 and 159 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
laws were passed which established severe penalties for the bribery
of electors. Another attempt to check the same abuse was the introduction
of the secret ballot for voting in the assemblies. The Gabinian
Law of 139 provided for the use of the ballot in elections; two
years later the Cassian Law extended its use to trials in the <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi>,
and in 131 it was finally employed in the legislative assemblies.
</p>

<p>
But these laws accomplished no great results, as they dealt merely
with the symptoms, and not with the cause of the disorder. And the
Roman Senate, deteriorating in capacity and morale, was facing administrative,
military, and social problems, which might well have
been beyond its power to solve even in the days of its greatness. As
we have indicated the Senate’s power rested largely upon its successful
foreign policy, but its initial failures in the last wars with
Macedonia and Carthage, and the long and bloody struggles in Spain,
had weakened its reputation and its claim to control the public policy
was challenged, from the middle of the second century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, by the
new commercial and capitalist class.
</p>

<pb n="109"/><anchor id="Pg109"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Roman Constitution from 265 to 133 B. C.</hi> During the
period in question there were few changes of importance in the political
organization of the Roman state. The dictatorship had been discarded,
although not abolished, before the close of the Hannibalic
War, a step which was in harmony with the policy of the Senate which
sought to prevent any official from attaining too independent a position.
In 242 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> a second praetorship, the office of the <hi rend="italic">praetor
peregrinus</hi> or alien praetor was established. The duty of this officer
was to preside over the trial of disputes arising between Roman citizens
and foreigners. Two additional praetorships were added in 227, and
two more in 197 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, to provide provincial governors of praetorian
rank. In 241 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the last two rural tribal districts were created,
making thirty-five tribes in all. Hereafter when new settlements
of Roman colonists were undertaken, or new peoples admitted to citizenship,
they were assigned to one or other of the old tribes, and
membership therein became hereditary, irrespective of change of
residence.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The reform of the centuries.</hi> At some time subsequent to the
creation of these last two tribes, very probably in the censorship of
Flaminius in 220 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, a change was made in the organization of the
centuriate assembly. The centuries were organized on the basis of the
tribes, an equal number of centuries of juniors and seniors of each
class being assigned to each tribe.<note place="foot">The details of this re-organization are uncertain. From our sources it is clear that
each of the first two classes had 70 centuries, one of seniors and one of juniors from each
of the 35 tribes. But we are left in the dark with regard to the other classes. Botsford,
in his <hi rend="italic">Roman Assemblies</hi>, would assign 70 centuries to each class; making a total of
350, plus the 18 equestrian and 5 supernumerary centuries, in all 373. Cavaignac,
<hi rend="italic">Histoire dé l’Antiquité</hi>, vol. III, gives 10 centuries to each of the three lower classes,
thus keeping the old number of 193 centuries in all.</note> The reform was evidently democratic
in its nature, as it diminished the relative importance of the
first class, deprived the equestrian centuries of the right of casting
the first votes—a right now exercised by a century chosen by lot for
each meeting—and placed in control of the Assembly of the Centuries
the same elements as controlled the Assembly of the Tribes.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The comitia an antiquated institution.</hi> But by the second century
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the Roman primary assemblies had become antiquated as
a vehicle for the expression of the wishes of the majority of the Roman
citizens, because with the spread of the Roman citizen body throughout
Italy it was impossible for more than a small percentage to attend
the meetings of the Comitia, and this situation became much worse
<pb n="110"/><anchor id="Pg110"/>with the settlement of Romans in their foreign dependencies. It was
the failure of the Romans to devise some adequate substitute for this
institution of a primitive city-state, which was largely responsible for
the people’s loss of its sovereign powers. As it was, the assemblies
came to be dominated by the urban proletariat, a class absolutely unfitted
to represent the Roman citizens as a whole.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The allies of Rome in Italy.</hi> The Latin and Italian allies, with
the exception of such as were punished for their defection in the
war with Hannibal, remained in their previous federate relationship
with Rome. However, the Romans were no longer careful to adhere
strictly to their treaty rights, and began to trespass upon the local
independence of their allies. Roman magistrates did not hesitate
to issue orders to the magistrates of federate communities, and to
punish them for failure to obey or for lack of respect. The spoils of
war, furthermore, were no longer divided in equal proportions between
the Roman and allied troops. Added to these aggravations
came the fact that the allies were after all dependents and had no
share in the government or the financial administration of the lands
they had helped to conquer. But their most serious grievance was
their obligation to military service, which was exacted without relaxation,
and which, owing to reasons which we shall discuss later,
had become much more burdensome than when originally imposed.
It is not surprising, then, to find that by 133 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the federate allies
were demanding to be admitted to Roman citizenship.
</p>

<p>
However, it was not in Rome or in Italy, but in Rome’s foreign
possessions that the important administrative development of the
third and second centuries occurred.
</p>

            <index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="II. The Administration of the Provinces"/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. The Administration of the Provinces</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The status of the conquered peoples.</hi> The acquisition of Sicily
in 241, and of Sardinia and Corsica in 238 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> raised the question
whether Rome should extend to her non-Italian conquests the same
treatment accorded to the Italian peoples and include them within her
military federation. This question was answered in the negative and
the status of federate allies was only accorded to such communities
as had previously attained this relationship or merited it by zeal in
the cause of Rome. All the rest were treated as subjects, not as
allies, enjoying only such rights as the conquerors chose to leave them.
<pb n="111"/><anchor id="Pg111"/>The distinguishing mark of their condition was their obligation to pay
a tax or tribute to Rome. Except on special occasions they were not
called upon to render military service.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The provinces.</hi> At first the Romans tried to conduct the administration
of Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica through the regular city magistrates,
but finding this unsatisfactory in 227 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> they created two
separate administrative districts—Sicily forming one, and the other
two islands the second—called provinces from the word <hi rend="italic">provincia</hi>,
which meant the sphere of duty assigned to a particular official. And
in fact special magistrates were assigned to them, two additional
praetors being annually elected for this purpose. In like manner
the Romans in 197 organized the provinces of Hither and Farther
Spain, in 148 the province of Macedonia, in 146 that of Africa, and
in 129 Asia. Subsequent conquests were treated in the same way.
For the Spanish provinces new praetorships were created, <q>with consular
authority</q> because of the military importance of their posts.
But for those afterwards organized no new magistracies were added,
and the practice was established of appointing as governor an ex-consul
or ex-praetor with the title of pro-consul or pro-praetor. This
method of appointing provincial governors became, as we shall see,
the rule for all provinces under the republican régime.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The provincial charter.</hi> Although each province had its own
peculiar features, in general all were organized and administered in
the following way. A provincial charter (<hi rend="italic">lex provinciae</hi>) drawn up
on the ground by a commission of ten senators and ratified by the
Senate fixed the rights and obligations of the provincials. Each
province was an aggregate of communities (<hi rend="italic">civitates</hi>), enjoying city
or tribal organization, which had no political bond of unity except
in the representative of the Roman authority. There were three
classes of these communities: the free and federate, the free and non-tributary,
and the tributary (<hi rend="italic">civitates liberae et foederatae</hi>, <hi rend="italic">liberae et
immunes</hi>, <hi rend="italic">stipendiariae</hi>). The first were few in number and although
within the borders of a province did not really belong to it, as they
were free allies of Rome whose status was assured by a permanent
treaty with the Roman state. The second class, likewise not very
numerous, enjoyed exemption from taxation by virtue of the provincial
charter, and this privilege the Senate could revoke at will. The third
group was by far the most numerous and furnished the tribute laid
upon the province. As a rule each of the communities enjoyed its
<pb n="112"/><anchor id="Pg112"/>former constitution and laws, subject to the supervision of the Roman
authorities.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Roman governor.</hi> Over this aggregate of communities stood
the Roman governor and his staff. We have already seen how the
governor was appointed and what was his rank among the Roman
magistrates. His term of office was regularly for one year, except
in the Spanish provinces where a term of two years was usual. His
duties were of a threefold nature: military, administrative, and judicial.
He was in command of the Roman troops stationed in the
province for the maintenance of order and the protection of the frontiers;
he supervised the relations between the communities of his
province and their internal administration, as well as the collection
of the tribute; he presided over the trial of the more serious cases
arising among provincials, over all cases between provincials and
Romans, or between Roman citizens. Upon entering his province
the governor published an edict, usually modelled upon that of his
predecessors or the praetor’s edict at Rome, stating what legal principles
he would enforce during his term of office. The province was
divided into judicial circuits (<hi rend="italic">conventus</hi>), and cases arising in each
of these were tried in designated places at fixed times.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The governor’s staff.</hi> The governor was accompanied by a
quaestor, who acted as his treasurer and received the provincial revenue
from the tax collectors. His staff also comprised three <hi rend="italic">legati</hi> or
lieutenants, senators appointed by the senate, but usually nominated
by himself, whose function it was to assist him with their counsel
and act as his deputies when necessary. He also took with him a
number of companions (<hi rend="italic">comites</hi>), usually young men from the families
of his friends, who were given this opportunity of gaining a knowledge
of provincial government and who could be used in any official
capacity. In addition, the governor brought his own retinue, comprising
clerks and household servants.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The provincial taxes.</hi> The taxes levied upon the provinces were
at first designed to pay the expenses of occupation and defence.
Hence they bore the name <hi rend="italic">stipendium</hi>, or soldiers’ pay. At a later
date the provinces were looked upon as the estates of the Roman
people and the taxes as a form of rental. The term <hi rend="italic">tributum</hi> (tribute),
used of the property tax imposed on Roman citizens did not
come into general use for the provincial revenues until a later epoch.
As a rule the Romans accepted the tax system already in vogue in
<pb n="113"/><anchor id="Pg113"/>each district before their occupancy, and exacted either a fixed annual
sum from the province as in Spain, Africa and Macedonia or one tenth
(<hi rend="italic">decuma</hi>) of the annual produce of the soil, as in Sicily and Asia.
The tribute imposed by the Romans was not higher, but usually lower
than what had been exacted by the previous rulers. The public lands,
mines, and forests, of the conquered state were incorporated in the
Roman public domain, and the right to occupy or exploit them was
leased to individuals or companies of contractors. Customs dues
(<hi rend="italic">portoria</hi>) were also collected in the harbors and on the frontiers of
the provinces.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The tax collectors.</hi> Following the custom established in Italy,
the Roman state did not collect its taxes in the provinces through
public officials but leased for a period of five years the right to
collect each particular tax to the private corporation of tax collectors
(<hi rend="italic">publicani</hi>) which made the highest bid for the privilege. These
corporations were joint stock companies, with a central office at Rome
and agencies in the provinces in which they were interested. It was
this system which was responsible for the greatest evils of Roman
provincial administration. For the <hi rend="italic">publicani</hi> were usually corporations
of Romans, bent on making a profit from their speculation, and
practised under the guise of raising the revenue, all manner of extortion
upon the provincials. It was the duty of the governor to check
their rapacity, but from want of sympathy with the oppressed and
unwillingness to offend the Roman business interests this duty was
rarely performed. Hand in hand with tax collecting went the business
of money lending, for the Romans found a state of chronic bankruptcy
prevailing in the Greek world and made loans everywhere at
exorbitant rates of interest. To collect overdue payments the Roman
bankers appealed to the governor, who usually quartered troops
upon delinquent communities until they satisfied their creditors.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The rapacity of the governors.</hi> A further source of misgovernment
lay in the greed of the governor and his staff. The temptations
of unrestricted power proved too great for the morality of the average
Roman. It is true that there were not wanting Roman governors who
maintained the highest traditions of Roman integrity in public office,
but there were also only too many who abused their power to enrich
themselves. While the shortness of his term of office prevented a
good governor from thoroughly understanding the conditions of his
province, it served to augment the criminal zeal with which an
ava<pb n="114"/><anchor id="Pg114"/>ricious proconsul, often heavily indebted from the expenses of his
election campaigns, sought to wring a fortune from the hapless provincials.
Bribes, presents, illegal exactions, and open confiscations
were the chief means of amassing wealth. In this the almost sovereign
position of the governor and his freedom from immediate senatorial
control guaranteed him a free hand.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The quaestio rerum repetundarum: 149 B. C.</hi> The mischief
became so serious that in 149 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the public conscience awoke to
the wrong and ruin inflicted upon the provinces, and by a Calpurnian
Law a standing court was instituted for the trial of officials accused of
extortion in the provinces. This court was composed of fifty jurors
drawn from the Senate and was presided over by a praetor. From
its judgment there was no appeal. Its establishment marks an important
innovation in Roman legal procedure in criminal cases. It
is possible also that the Senate was encouraged to undertake the organization
of new provinces shortly after 149 because it believed that
this court would serve as an adequate means of controlling the provincial
governors. But it was useless to expect very much from such
a tribunal. The cost of a long trial at Rome, the difficulty of securing
testimony, the inadequacy of the penalty provided, which was
limited to restitution of the damage inflicted, as well as the fear of
vengeance from future governors, would deter the majority of sufferers
from seeking reparation. Nor could an impartial verdict be expected
from a jury of senators trying one of their own number for an offense
which many of them regarded as their prerogative. And so till the
end of the republic the provincials suffered from the oppression of
their governors, as well as from that of the tax-collectors.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. Social and Economic Development</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Outstanding characteristics of the period.</hi> The epoch of foreign
expansion which we are considering was marked by a complete
revolution in the social and economic life of Rome and Italy. It witnessed
the spread of the slave plantations, the decline of the free
Italian peasantry, the growth of the city mob of Rome, the great increase
in the power of the commercial and capitalist class, and the
introduction of a new standard of living among the well-to-do.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The slave <anchor id="corr114"/><corr sic="plantations,">plantations.</corr></hi> The introduction of the plantation system,
that is, of the cultivation of large estates (<hi rend="italic">latifundia</hi>) by slave
<pb n="115"/><anchor id="Pg115"/>labor, was the result of several causes: the Roman system of administering
the public domain, the devastation of the rural districts of
South Italy in the Hannibalic War, the abundant supply of cheap
slaves taken as prisoners of war, and the inability of the small proprietors
to maintain themselves in the face of the demands of military
service abroad and the competition of imported grain as well as
that of the <hi rend="italic">latifundia</hi> themselves.
</p>

<p>
The public domain that was not required for purposes of colonization
had always been open for pasturage or cultivation to persons
paying a nominal rental to the state. Those who profited most from
this system were the wealthier landholders who could occupy and
cultivate very considerable areas. This fact explains the senatorial
opposition to the division and settlement of the <hi rend="italic">ager Gallicus</hi> proposed
and carried by the tribune Flaminius in 233 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> The dangers
of the practice to the smaller proprietors caused the passing of
laws, probably late in the third century, which limited the amount of
public land to be occupied by any individual and his family. But
these laws were disregarded, for the Senate administered the public
domain and the senators were the wealthy landholders. After several
generations the public lands occupied in this way came to be regarded
as private property. The havoc wrought by Hannibal in
South Italy, where he destroyed four hundred communities, caused the
disappearance of the country population and opened the way for the
acquisition of large estates there, and the law which restricted the
commercial activities of senators and forbade their engaging in tax
collecting or undertaking similar state contracts encouraged them to
invest their capital in Italian land and stimulated the growth of their
holdings.
</p>

<p>
The change in agrarian conditions in Italy was also advantageous
to large estates. The cheapness of Sicilian grain rendered it more
profitable in Italy to cultivate vineyards and olive orchards, and to
raise cattle and sheep on a large scale. For the latter wide acreages
were needed: a summer pasturage in the mountains and a winter one
in the lowlands of the coast. Abundant capital and cheap labor were
other requisites. And slaves were to be had in such numbers that
their labor was exploited without regard for their lives. Cato the
Elder, who exemplified the vices as well as the virtues of the old
Roman character, treated his slaves like cattle and recommended
that they be disposed of when no longer fit for work. Often the
<pb n="116"/><anchor id="Pg116"/>slaves worked in irons, and were housed in underground prisons
(<hi rend="italic">ergastula</hi>). The dangers of the presence of such masses of slaves so
brutally treated came to light in the Sicilian Slave War which broke
out in 136 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, when over 200,000 of them rebelled and defied the
Roman arms for a period of four years.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The decline of the free peasantry.</hi> Partly a cause and partly a
result of the spread of the <hi rend="italic">latifundia</hi> was the decline of the free
Italian peasantry. As we have seen, the competition of the slave
plantations proved ruinous to those who tilled their own land. But
another very potent cause contributing to this result was the burden
imposed by Rome’s foreign wars. Since only those who had a property
assessment of at least 4000 asses were liable to military service,
and since the majority of Roman citizens were engaged in agricultural
occupations, the Roman armies were chiefly recruited from
the country population. And no longer for a part of each year only,
but for a number of consecutive years, was the peasant soldier kept
from his home to the inevitable detriment of his fields and his
finances. Furthermore, a long period of military service with the
chances of gaining temporary riches from the spoils of war unfitted
men for the steady, laborious life of the farm. And so many discharged
soldiers, returning to find that their lands had been mortgaged
in their absence for the support of their families, and being
unable or unwilling to gain a livelihood on their small estates, let
these pass into the hands of their wealthier neighbors and flocked to
Rome to swell the mob of idlers there. Then came the heavy losses
of the Second Punic and the Spanish Wars. Although the census
list of Roman citizens eligible for military service shows an increase
in the first half of the second century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, between 164 and 136 it
sank from 337,000 to 317,000. Yet the levies had to be raised, even
if, as we have seen, they were unpopular enough to induce the tribunes
to intercede against them. The Latin and Italian allies felt the
same drain as the Roman citizens, but had no recourse to the tribunician
intercession. The Senate was consequently brought face to
face with a very serious military problem. The provinces, once occupied,
had to be kept in subjection and defended. Since the Roman
government would not, or dare not, raise armies in the provinces, it
had to meet increasing military obligations with declining resources.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The urban proletariat.</hi> Another difficulty was destined to arise
from the growth of a turbulent mob in Rome itself. This was in
<pb n="117"/><anchor id="Pg117"/>large measure due to Rome’s position as the political and commercial
center of the Mediterranean world. By the end of this period of
expansion the city had a population of at least half a million, rivalling
Alexandria and Antioch, the great Hellenistic capitals. Although
not a manufacturing city, Rome had always been important as a market,
and now her streets were thronged with traders from all lands,
and with persons who could cater in any way to the wants and the
appetites of an imperial city. There was a large proportion of slaves
belonging to the mansions of the wealthy, and of freedmen engaged in
business for themselves or for their patrons. Hither flocked also the
peasants who for various reasons had abandoned their agricultural
pursuits to pick up a precarious living in the city or to depend upon
the bounty of the patron to whom they attached themselves. Owing
to the slowness of transportation by land and its uncertainties by sea,
the congestion of population in Rome made the problem of supplying
the city with food one of great difficulty, since a rise in the price of
grain, or a delay in the arrival of the Sicilian wheat convoy would
bring the proletariat to the verge of starvation. And upon the popular
assemblies the presence of this unstable element had an unwholesome
effect. Dominated as these assemblies were by those who resided
in the city, their actions were bound to be determined by the particular
interests and passions of this portion of the citizen body.
Furthermore, in the <hi rend="italic">contiones</hi> or mass meetings for political purposes,
non-citizens as well as citizens could attend, and this afforded a ready
means for evoking the mob spirit in the hope of overawing the
Comitia. This danger would not have been present if the Roman
constitution had provided adequate means for policing the city. As
it was, however, beyond the magistrates and their personal attendants,
there were no persons authorized to maintain order in the city. And
since the consuls lacked military authority within the <hi rend="italic">pomerium</hi>,
there were no armed forces at their disposal.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The equestrian order.</hi> The Roman custom of depending as
much as possible upon individual initiative for the conduct of public
business, as in the construction of roads, aqueducts and other public
works, the operation of mines, and the collection of taxes of all kinds,
had given rise to a class of professional public contractors—the
<hi rend="italic">publicani</hi>. Their operations, with the allied occupations of banking
and money-lending, had been greatly enlarged by the period of
war and conquest which followed 265 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> through the opportunities
<pb n="118"/><anchor id="Pg118"/>it brought for the exploitation of subject peoples. Roman commerce,
too, had spread with the extension of Roman political influence. The
exclusion of senators from direct participation in these ventures led to
the rise of a numerous, wealthy and influential class whose interests
differed from and often ran counter to those of the senatorial order.
In general they supported an aggressive foreign policy, with the ruthless
exploitation of conquered peoples, and they were powerful enough
to influence the destruction of Carthage and Corinth. In the course
of the second century this class developed into a distinct order in the
state—the equestrians. Since the Roman cavalry had practically
ceased to serve in the field, the term <hi rend="italic">equites</hi> came to be applied to all
those whose property would have permitted their serving as cavalry at
their own expense. The majority of these was formed by the business
class, although under the name of equestrians were still included such
members of the senatorial families as had not yet held office.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The new scale of living.</hi> In the course of their campaigns in
Sicily, Africa, Greece, and Asia Minor, the Romans came into close
contact with a civilization older and higher than their own, where the
art of living was practised with a refinement and elegance unknown
in Latium. In this respect the conquerors showed themselves only
too ready to learn from the conquered, and all the luxurious externals
of culture were transplanted to Rome. But the old Periclean motto,
<q>refinement without extravagance,</q> did not appeal to the Romans
who, like typical <hi rend="italic">nouveaux riches</hi> vied with one another in the extravagant
display of their wealth. The simple Roman house with
its one large <hi rend="italic">atrium</hi>, serving at once as kitchen, living room, and bed
chamber, was completely transformed. The <hi rend="italic">atrium</hi> became a pillared
reception hall, special rooms were added for the various phases of
domestic life; in the rear of the <hi rend="italic">atrium</hi> arose a Greek peristyle courtyard,
and the house was filled with costly sculptures and other works
of art, plundered or purchased in the cities of Hellas. Banquets
were served on silver plate and exhibited the rarest and costliest
dishes. The homes of the wealthy were thronged with retinues of
slaves, each specially trained for some particular task; the looms of
the East supplied garments of delicate texture. A wide gulf yawned
between the life of the rich and the life of the poor.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Sumptuary legislation.</hi> But the change did not come about without
vigorous opposition from the champions of the old Roman simplicity
of life who saw in the new refinement and luxury a danger to
<pb n="119"/><anchor id="Pg119"/>Roman vigor and morality. The spokesman of the reactionaries was
Cato the Elder, who in his censorship in 184 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> assessed articles of
luxury and expensive slaves at ten times their market value and made
them liable to taxation at an exceptionally high rate, in case the
property tax should be levied. But such action was contrary to the
spirit of the age; the next censors let his regulations fall into abeyance.
Attempts to check the growth of luxury by legislation were equally
futile. The Oppian Law, passed under stress of the need for conservation
in 215 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, restricting female extravagance in dress and
ornaments, was repealed in 195, and subsequent attempts at sumptuary
legislation in 181, 161, and 143, were equally in vain.
</p>

<p>
To resume: in 133 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the Roman state was faced with a bitter
contest between the Senate and the equestrians for the control of the
government, the Comitia was dominated by an unstable urban proletariat,
the provisioning of Rome was a source of anxiety, dissatisfaction
was rife among the Latin and Italian allies, the military resources
of the state were weakening, while its military burdens were
greater than ever, and the ruling circles had begun to display unmistakable
signs of a declining public morality. With a constitution
adapted to a city-state Rome was now forced to grapple with all the
problems of imperial government.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">IV. Cultural Progress</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Greek influences.</hi> In addition to creating new administrative
problems and transforming the economic life of Italy, the expansion
of Rome gave a tremendous impulse to its cultural development. The
chief stimulus thereto was the close contact with Hellenic civilization.
We have previously mentioned that Rome had been subject to Greek
influences both indirectly through Etruria and directly from the Greek
cities of South Italy, but with the conquest of the latter, and the occupation
of Sicily, Greece, and part of Asia Minor, these influences became
infinitely more immediate and powerful. They were intensified
by the number of Greeks who flocked to Rome as ambassadors,
teachers, physicians, merchants and artists, and by the multitude of
educated Greek slaves employed in Roman households. And as the
Hellenic civilization was more ancient and had reached a higher
stage than the Latin, it was inevitable that the latter should borrow
largely from the former and consciously or unconsciously imitate it
<pb n="120"/><anchor id="Pg120"/>in many respects. In fact the intellectual life of Rome never attained
the freedom and richness of that of Greece upon which it was
always dependent. In this domain, as Horace phrased it, <q>Captive
Greece took captive her rude conqueror.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">New tendencies in Roman education.</hi> A knowledge of Greek
now became part of the equipment of every educated man, the training
of the sons of the well-to-do was placed in the hands of Greek
tutors, who were chiefly domestic slaves, and the study of the masterpieces
of Greek literature created the genuine admiration for Greek
achievements and the respect that men like Flamininus showed towards
their Greek contemporaries—a respect which the political
ineptitude of the latter soon changed to contempt. These tendencies
were vigorously opposed by the conservative Cato, who regarded
Greek influences as demoralizing. Following the old Roman custom
he personally trained his sons, and had no sympathy with a philhellenic
foreign policy. But even Cato in the end yielded so far as
to learn Greek. The chief patrons of Hellenism were men of the
type of Scipio Africanus the Elder; notably Titus Flamininus,
Aemilius Paulus and Scipio Aemilianus, at whose house gathered the
leading intellectuals of the day. Intimate associates there were the
Achaean historian Polybius and the Stoic philosopher Panaetius of
Rhodes.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Roman literature: I. Poetry.</hi> More than anything else Greek
influences contributed to the rise of Roman literature. Prior to the
war with Hannibal the Romans had no literature, although Latin
prose had attained a certain development in the formulation of laws
and treaties and a rude Latin verse had appeared.
</p>

<p>
Not unnaturally Roman literature began with translations from
the Greek, and here poetry preceded prose. In the latter half of the
third century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Livius Andronicus, a Greek freedman, translated
the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> into Latin Saturnian verse, as a text-book for school use.
He also translated Greek comedies and tragedies. At about the same
time Cnaeus Naevius wrote comedies and tragedies having Roman as
well as Greek subjects. He also composed an epic poem on the First
Punic War, still using the native Saturnian.
</p>

<p>
Dramatic literature developed rapidly under the demand for plays
to be presented at the public festivals. In the second century appeared
the great comic poet Plautus, who drew his subjects from the
Greek New Comedy, but whose metre and language were strictly
<pb n="121"/><anchor id="Pg121"/>Latin. He was followed by Terence, a man of lesser genius, who
depended largely upon Greek originals, but who was distinguished
for the purity and elegance of his Latin. A later dramatist of note
was Lucius Accius, who brought Roman tragedy to its height. In
both comedy and tragedy Greek plots and characters were gradually
abandoned for those of native origin, but tragedy failed to appeal to
the Roman public which was in general too uneducated to appreciate
its worth and preferred the comedy, mime or gladiatorial combat. A
notable figure is Ennius, a Messapian, who began to write at the close
of the third century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> He created the Latin hexameter verse in
which he wrote a great epic portraying the history of Rome from the
migration of Aeneas. Another famous member of the Scipionic circle
was Gaius Lucilius, a Roman of equestrian rank, who originated
the one specifically Roman contribution to literary types, the satire.
His poems were a criticism of life in all its aspects, public and private.
He called them <q>talks</q> (<hi rend="italic">sermones</hi>), but they received the
popular name of satires because their colloquial language and the variety
of their subjects recalled the native Italian medley of prose and
verse, narrative and drama, known as the <hi rend="italic">satura</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">II. Prose.</hi> Latin prose developed more slowly. The earliest Roman
historical works by Fabius Pictor (after 201 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>), Cincius
Alimentus, and others, were written in Greek, for in that language
alone could they find suitable models. It remained for Cato, here as
elsewhere the foe of Hellenism, to create Latin historical prose in his
<hi rend="italic">Origins</hi>, an account of the beginnings of Rome and the Italian peoples
written about 168 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> His earlier work on agriculture was the first
book in Latin prose. The work of the Carthaginian Mago on the
same subject was translated into Latin by a commission appointed by
the Senate.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Oratory.</hi> The demands of public life in Rome had already created
a native oratory. A speech delivered by Appius Claudius in 279 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
had been written down and published, as were several funeral orations
from the close of the third century. But it was Cato who first published
a collection of his speeches, about one hundred and fifty in
number, which enjoyed a great reputation. A new impulse to this
branch of literature was given by the introduction of the systematic
study of rhetoric under the influence of Greek orators and teachers.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Juristic writings.</hi> In the field of jurisprudence the Romans at
this period, were but little subject to Greek influences. The
codifica<pb n="122"/><anchor id="Pg122"/>tion of the law in the fifth century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> had been followed by the
introduction of new principles and forms of action, chiefly through
the praetor’s edict. The necessity arose of harmonizing the old law
and the new, and of systematizing the various forms of legal procedure.
Roman juristic literature begins with Sextus Aelius Paetus
(consul in 198 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>), surnamed Catus <q>the shrewd,</q> who compiled
a work which later generations regarded as <q>the cradle of the law.</q>
It was in three parts; the first contained an interpretation of the
XII Tables, the second the development of the law by the jurists,
and the third new methods of legal procedure. A knowledge of the
law had always been highly esteemed at Rome and the position of a
jurist consult, that is, one who was consulted on difficult legal problems,
was one of especial honor. Consequently the study of the law,
together with that of oratory, formed the regular preparation for the
Roman who aimed at a public career.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Religion.</hi> Greek religion, like Greek literature, had attained a
more advanced stage than that of Rome, and possessed a rich mythology
when the Romans had barely begun to ascribe distinct personalities
to their gods. Hence there came about a ready identification between
Greek and Roman divinities to whom similar powers were
ascribed and the wholesale adoption of Greek mythological lore. By
the close of the third century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> there was formally recognized in
Rome a group of twelve greater divinities who were identical with the
twelve Olympic gods of Greece. There ensued also a rapid neglect of
the minor Latin divinities whose place was taken by those of Greek
origin. The old impersonal Roman deities had given place to
anthropomorphic Hellenic conceptions. This is reflected in the acceptance
of Greek types for the plastic representations of the gods, a
strong demand for which arose with the acquaintance of the works of
art carried off from Syracuse and other Greek cities. An important
factor in this hellenization of the Roman religion was the influence
of the Sibylline Books, a collection of Greek oracles imported from
Cumae in the days of the Roman kings and consulted in times of national
danger.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The decree of the Senate against Bacchanalian societies:
186 B. C.</hi> But Greek influence in the sphere of religion went deeper
than the identification of Greek and Roman divinities, for the emotional
cult of Bacchus with its mystic ceremonies and doctrines made
its way into Italy where religious associations for its celebration were
<pb n="123"/><anchor id="Pg123"/>formed even in Rome itself. The demoralizing effects of this worship
called forth a senatorial investigation which resulted, as we have
seen, in the suppression of these associations. A similar action was
taken with regard to the Chaldean astrologers, banished from Italy
in 139 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The worship of the Great Mother.</hi> Of a different character was
the cult of the Great Mother officially introduced into Rome in the
year 204 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> This was in essence a native nature worship of Asia
Minor, disguised with a veneer of Hellenism. It was the first of the
so-called Oriental cults to obtain a footing in the Roman world.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Skepticism and Stoicism.</hi> Although the formalities of religion
in so far as they concerned public life were still scrupulously observed,
there was an ever increasing skepticism with regard to the
existence and power of the gods of the Graeco-Roman mythology.
This was especially true of the educated classes, who were influenced
to a certain extent by the rationalism of Euhemerus, whose work on
the origin of the gods had been translated by Ennius, but much more
by the pantheism of the Stoic philosophy. The Stoic doctrines, with
their practical ethical prescriptions, made a strong appeal to the
Roman character and found an able expositor in Panaetius of Rhodes
who taught under the patronage of Scipio Aemilianus.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Public festivals.</hi> Of great importance in the life of the city were
the annual public festivals or games, of which six came to be regularly
celebrated by the middle of the second century, each lasting for
several days. Five of these were celebrated by the aediles, one by
the city praetor. A fixed sum was allotted by the state to defray the
expenses of these exhibits, but custom required that this must be
largely supplemented from the private purse of the person in charge.
In this way the aedileship afforded an excellent opportunity to win
public favor by an exhibition of generosity. To the original horse
and chariot races there came to be added scenic productions, wild
beast hunts, and gladiatorial combats, in imitation of those exhibited
by private persons. The first private exhibition of gladiators was
given at a funeral in 264 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, and the first wild beast hunt in 186
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> These types of exhibitions soon became the most popular of all
and exercised a brutalizing effect upon the spectators.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The city Rome.</hi> The growth of Rome in population and wealth
brought about a corresponding change in the appearance of the city.
Tenement houses of several stories and high rentals reflected the
<pb n="124"/><anchor id="Pg124"/>influx into the capital. Public buildings began to be erected on a
large scale. The Circus Flaminius dates from the end of the third
century, and several basilicas or large public halls, suitable as places
for transacting business or conducting judicial hearings, were erected
by 169 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> A new stone bridge was built across the Tiber, a quay
to facilitate the unloading of ships was constructed on the bank of the
river, a third aqueduct brought into the city, and stone paving laid on
many streets. Many temples were erected, adorned with votive offerings,
mainly spoils of war from Greek cities. But no native art or
architecture arose that was worthy of the imperial position of Rome.

<head>THE STRUGGLE OF THE OPTIMATES AND THE
POPULARES: 133–78 B. C.</head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Civil war and imperial expansion.</hi> The century which began
with the year 133 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> is characterized by a condition of perpetual
factional strife within the Roman state; strife which frequently blazed
forth into civil war and which culminated in the fall of the republican
system of government.
</p>

<p>
The question at issue was the right of the Senate to direct the
policy of Rome, and this right was challenged by the tribunate and the
Assembly of Tribes, by the equestrian order, and by the great military
leaders who appeared in the course of civil and foreign wars.
</p>

<p>
For in spite of these unceasing internal disorders this century marks
an imperial expansion which rivalled that of the era of the Punic
and Macedonian Wars. In Gaul the Roman sway was extended to
the Rhine and the Ocean; in the east practically the whole peninsula
of Asia Minor, as well as Syria and Egypt, was incorporated in the
Empire. With the exception of Mauretania (i. e. modern Morocco,
which was really a Roman dependency) the Roman provinces completely
encircled the Mediterranean.
</p>

<p>
At the same time a new Italian nation was created by the admission
to Roman citizenship of all the peoples dwelling in Italy south
of the Alps.
</p>

<p>
The period 133 to 78 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> covers the first stage in the struggle
which brought the Republic to an end, and closes with the Senate in
full possession of its old prerogatives, while the powers of the tribunate
and Assembly have been seriously curtailed. In this struggle the
Roman citizen body was aligned in two groups. The one, which
supported the claims of the Senate, was called the party of the <q>Optimates</q>
or aristocrats; the other, which challenged these claims, was
known as the people’s party or the <q>Populares.</q>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">I. The Agrarian Laws of Tiberius Gracchus: 133 b. c.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Tiberius Gracchus, tribune, 133 B. C.</hi> The opening of the struggle
was brought on by the agrarian legislation proposed by Tiberius
Gracchus, a tribune for the year 133 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Gracchus, then thirty
years of age, was one of the most prominent young Romans of his
time, being the son of the consul whose name he bore and of Cornelia,
daughter of the great Scipio Africanus. Under his mother’s supervision,
he had received a careful education, which included rhetoric
and Greek Stoic philosophy. As quaestor in Spain in 136 he had
distinguished himself for courage and honesty in dealing with the
native population and had acquainted himself with the military needs
of Rome. He saw in the decline of the free peasantry of Italy the
chief menace to the state, and when elected to the tribunate proposed
legislation which aimed to re-establish the class of free Roman farmers,
and thus provide new strength for the Roman armies.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The land law.</hi> His proposed land law took the form of a re-enactment
of a previous agrarian measure dating, probably, from
the end of the third century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> This law had restricted the amount
of public land which any person might occupy to five hundred iugera
(about three hundred and ten acres), an amount which Gracchus
augmented by two hundred and fifty iugera for each of two grown
sons. All land held in excess of this limit was to be surrendered to
the state, further occupation of public land was forbidden, and
what was within the legal limit was to be declared private property.
Compensation for improvements on surrendered lands was offered to
the late occupants, and a commission of three men was to be annually
elected with judicial powers to decide upon the rights of possessors
(<hi rend="italic">III vir agris iudicandis assignandis</hi>). The land thus resumed by
the state was to be assigned by the commissioners to landless Roman
citizens in small allotments, incapable of alienation, and subject to a
nominal rental to the state.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Deposition of the tribune Octavius.</hi> This proposal aroused
widespread consternation among the Senators, who saw their holdings
threatened. In many cases it had doubtless become impossible for
them to distinguish between their private properties and the public
lands occupied by their families for several generations. The Senate
resorted to its customary procedure in protecting its prerogatives and
induced a tribune named Octavius to veto the measure. But
Grac<pb n="127"/><anchor id="Pg127"/>chus was terribly in earnest with his project of reform and took the
unprecedented step of appealing to the Assembly of the Tribes to
depose Octavius, on the ground that he was thwarting the will of the
people. The Assembly voiced their approval of Tiberius by depriving
his opponent of his office. The land bill was thereupon presented
to the Assembly and passed. The first commissioners elected
to carry it into effect were Tiberius himself, his younger brother
Caius, and his father-in-law, Appius Claudius.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Death of Tiberius Gracchus.</hi> To equip the allotments made to
poor settlers, Tiberius proposed the appropriation of the treasure of
King Attalus III of Pergamon, to which the Roman state had lately
fallen heir. Here was a direct attack upon the Senate’s customary
control of such matters. But before this proposal could be presented
to the Comitia, the elections to the tribunate for 132 fell due. Tiberius
determined to present himself for re-election in order to ensure
the carrying out of his land law and to protect himself from prosecution
on the ground of the unconstitutionality of some of his actions.
Such a procedure was unusual, if not illegal, and the Senate determined
to prevent it at any cost. The elections culminated in a riot
in which Gracchus and three hundred adherents were massacred by
the armed slaves and clients of the senators. Their bodies were
thrown into the Tiber. A judicial commission appointed by the
Senate sought out and punished the leading supporters of the murdered
tribune.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The fate of the land commission.</hi> However, the land law remained
in force and the commission set to work. But in 129 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
the commissioners were deprived of their judicial powers, and, since
they could no longer expropriate land, their activity practically
ceased.
</p>

<p>
Still, the Senate’s opponents were not utterly crushed. In 131 an
attempt was made to legalize re-election to the tribunate, and although
the proposal failed at first, a law to that effect was passed some time
prior to 123 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> In the year 129 died Scipio Aemilianus, the conqueror
of Carthage and Numantia, the foremost Roman of the day.
Upon returning from Spain in 132 he had energetically taken sides
with the Senate and had caused the land commissioners to lose their
right of jurisdiction. Thereby he had become exceedingly unpopular
with the Gracchan party, and when he died suddenly in his fifty-sixth
year, there were not wanting those who accused his wife
Sem<pb n="128"/><anchor id="Pg128"/>pronia, sister of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus, and others of their
family, of being responsible for his decease.
</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. The Tribunate of Caius Gracchus: 124–121 b. c.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Caius Gracchus, tribune, 123 B. C.</hi> The return of Caius Gracchus
from his quaestorship in Sardinia in 124 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> and his immediate
election to the tribunate for the ensuing year heralded the opening
of a new phase in the conflict between the Optimates and the
Populares. Caius was a passionate orator, and a man of greater
energy and more violent temperament than his brother. He entered
office pledged to support the agrarian policy of Tiberius, but likewise
determined to avenge the latter’s death and to wrest from the Senate
its control of the government.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The legislation of Caius Gracchus, 123 B. C.</hi> Upon assuming
office Caius developed an extensive legislative program. Extraordinary
judicial commissions established by the Senate were declared
illegal and the ex-consul Popilius who had been the leader in the
prosecution of the followers of Tiberius, was forced into exile. A
law was passed which provided for a monthly distribution of grain to
the city populace at one half the current market price. In this way
an expedient which had occasionally been resorted to in times of distress
was laid as a permanent obligation upon the government. It
has been pointed out above that the lower classes in the city lived in
perpetual danger of famine, and Caius probably hoped to relieve the
state of the perpetual menace of a hungry proletariat at the capital by
improving the arrangements for the city’s grain supply and lowering
the cost of grain to the poor. But in the end this measure had the
evil results of putting a severe drain upon the treasury and a premium
upon idleness. For the moment, however, it made the city mob
devoted adherents of Caius and strengthened his control of the Assembly.
The land law of 133 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> was re-enacted and the land commissioners
reclothed with judicial authority. In connection therewith
there was undertaken the extension and improvement of the road
system of Italy. Caius then assured himself of the support of the
financial interests by a law which provided that the whole revenue
from the new province of Asia should be auctioned off at Rome in a
lump to Roman contractors. A rich field was thus opened up to the
Roman bankers.
</p>

<pb n="129"/><anchor id="Pg129"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Caius re-elected tribune for 122 B. C.</hi> The activity of Caius in
supervising the execution of his legislation made him the leading
figure in the government, and he was re-elected to the tribunate for
122 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> It seemed as though a sort of Periclean democracy had
been established in Rome, where the statesman who commanded a majority
in the popular assembly by securing his continuous re-election to
the tribunate might supplant the Senate in directing the public policy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Judiciary Law, 123 B. C.</hi> Gracchus continued his legislative
activity. One of his most important laws was that which deprived
senators of the right to act as judges in the courts, including
the permanent <hi rend="italic">quaestiones</hi>, and transferred this prerogative to the
equestrians. This was probably done by defining the qualifications
of jurors in such a way as to exclude both senators and those not
potentially able to maintain the equipment of a cavalryman at their
own expense, i. e. those assessed at less than 400,000 sesterces
($20,000). By the Acilian Law of 123, which reorganized the
<hi rend="italic">quaestio</hi> for the recovery of damages, the relatives of senators, who
were still eligible to the eighteen equestrian centuries, were specifically
excluded from serving as jurors. In this way the equestrian order in
its widest sense was defined and, being given specific public duties,
was rendered more conscious of its power and special interests. In
consequence the permanent tribunal for trying officials charged with
extortion in the provinces was manned by <hi rend="italic">equites</hi> instead of senators.
But the change brought no relief to the subjects of Rome for this court
was now composed of men who were interested in the financial exploitation
of the provincials and who thus were in a position to intimidate
a governor who endeavored to restrain the rapacity of tax
collectors and money-lenders. The control of the law courts became
a standing bone of contention between the Senate and the equestrian
order. Another law, which further restricted the powers of the Senate,
dealt with the allotment of the consular provinces. Previously these
had been assigned by the Senate after the election of the consuls, so
that the activities of one distrusted by the senators could be considerably
restricted. For the future the consular provinces had to be
designated prior to the elections and then assigned to the successful
candidates. The Senate’s control over the consuls was thereby considerably
weakened.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Schemes for <anchor id="corr129"/><corr sic="Colonization">colonization</corr> and <corr sic="Extension">extension</corr> of Roman
    <corr sic="Citizenship">citizenship</corr>.</hi>
Caius also secured the passage of an extensive scheme of colonization,
<pb n="130"/><anchor id="Pg130"/>which provided for the establishment of Roman colonies at Capua and
Tarentum, and, what was an innovation, for a colony outside of Italy
on the site of Carthage. He further championed the cause of the
Latin and Italian allies, for whom he sought to secure Roman citizenship.
The Senatorial party thereupon endeavored to undermine his
influence with the people by proposing through the tribune Livius
Drusus a more extensive scheme of colonization, with exemption from
rentals for colonists, and opposing the extension of the franchise to
the allied communities, a measure unpopular with the masses who
were jealous of sharing their privileges with numbers of new citizens.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The overthrow of Caius Gracchus: 121 B. C.</hi> Caius personally
undertook the foundation of the colony, named Junonia, which was
located at Carthage, and his absence of seventy days on this mission
gave the opposition time to organize their forces. His enemies accused
him of aiming at a tyranny, his proposal for extension of the
franchise was quashed by the veto of Drusus, and he himself failed
to secure his election as tribune for 121. With the opening of that
year the Senate initiated an attack upon some of his measures, especially
the founding of Junonia. The senators were determined to
impeach or kill Gracchus, while he and his friends organized themselves
for defence. A riot in which one of the senatorial faction was
killed gave the Senate the pretext to proclaim a state of martial law
and authorize the consul Opimius to take any steps to safeguard the
state. The followers of Gracchus assembled on the Aventine, their
overtures were rejected and upon the refusal of Caius and his chief
adherent Flaccus to appear before the Senate, Opimius attacked them
at the head of the Senators, armed slaves and Cretan archers. The
Gracchans were routed; Caius had himself killed by a faithful slave,
and a judicial commission condemned three thousand of his followers.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The consequences of the Gracchan disorders.</hi> The memory of
the Gracchi retained a lasting hold upon the affections of the Roman
plebs. But although both were earnest patriots, who made a sincere
attempt to reform existing abuses in the state, one cannot but feel that
the success of their political aims would have brought about no permanent
improvement. To substitute for the Senate the fickle Assembly
as the governing force in the state was no true democratic measure
owing to the fact that the Assembly did not properly represent the
mass of the citizen body, and as the future years were to show, would
merely have shifted the reins of power from one incompetent body
<pb n="131"/><anchor id="Pg131"/>to another more incompetent still. As it was, the Senate, although
victorious, emerged from the contest weakened in authority and prestige,
and having left a feeling of bitter resentment in the hearts of
its opponents. It owed its success to violence and not to legal measures
and thus offered a precedent which others might follow against
itself. The alliance between the equestrians and the urban proletariat
while it lasted had proven stronger than the Senate, and this lesson,
too, was not lost upon future statesmen. Besides the loss of some of
its prerogatives, the Senate was weakened by the consolidation of the
business interests as a political party, with which it was brought into
sharp opposition over the question of provincial government. Well
might Caius Gracchus declare that by his judiciary law he had
<q>thrust a dagger into the side of the Senate.</q> For the provincials,
the result of this law was to usher in an era of increased oppression
and misgovernment. The refusal of the Romans to grant the franchise
to the allies served to estrange them still further from Rome.
On the whole we may say that conditions in Rome, Italy and the
provinces were worse after the time of the Gracchi than before.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Fate of the agrarian legislation.</hi> It is impossible to estimate
how many Romans received allotments of land under the Gracchan
laws. Although the census list rose from 317,000 in 136 to 394,000
in 125, we cannot ascribe this increase altogether to an increase in the
number of small proprietors. The admission of freedmen to citizenship
doubtless accounts for many. Still there was beyond question a
decided addition made to the free peasantry. The colony of Junonia
was abandoned, but the settlers in Africa were left undisturbed on
their lands. By 120 the restrictions on the sale of allotments in Italy
were withdrawn; in 118 assignments ceased; and in 111 rentals to the
state were abolished and all lands then held in possession were declared
private property; an enactment which benefited greatly the
wealthy proprietors.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. The War with Jugurtha and the Rise of Marius</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Foreign wars of the Gracchan Age.</hi> While the Senate and the
Gracchi were struggling for the mastery in Rome, the Roman state
engaged in continual frontier struggles, particularly on the northern
borders of Italy and Macedonia. Most of these wars were of slight
importance, but one resulted in the occupation of the <anchor id="corr131"/><corr sic="Balaeric">Balearic</corr> Islands,
<pb n="132"/><anchor id="Pg132"/>in 123–122, which gave Rome full command of the sea route to Spain.
Another, still more important, was that waged between 125 and 123
in answer to an appeal from Massalia against the Ligurian Salyes to
the north of that city. Their subjugation gave the Romans the
command of the route across the Maritime Alps from Italy to Gaul.
The fortress of Aquae Sextiae was established to guard this passage.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Roman advance in Transalpine Gaul.</hi> It now became the
object of the Romans to secure the land route to Spain. But beyond
the territory of their ally Massalia the way was blocked by powerful
coalitions of Gallic tribes. Chief among these were the Allobroges
to the east of the Rhone, the Arverni the greatest of all, whose territory
lay west of that river, from the Loire to the Pyrenees, and the
Aedui, to the north of the Arverni. The Romans made an alliance
with the latter people who were at enmity with the other two, and attacked
the Allobroges because they had received fugitives from the
Salyes. The Arverni were drawn into the conflict on the side of the
Allobroges.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The province of Narbonese Gaul.</hi> In 121 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> both these peoples
were decisively beaten in a great battle near the junction of the
Isère and the Rhone by the consul Fabius Maximus and the proconsul
Domitius. The Romans were now masters of all southern
Gaul, except Massalia, and organized it as a province. In 118 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
a Roman colony was established at Narbo, which was with the exception
of the abandoned settlement of Junonia, the first colony of
Roman citizens sent beyond the Italian peninsula, although colonies
with Latin rights had been founded in Spain long before. To
link Italy with Spain there was constructed the <hi rend="italic">via Domitia</hi>, a military
road traversing the new province.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Jugurthine War.</hi> It was not long before Rome became involved
in a much more serious conflict that was destined to reveal
to the world the rottenness and incapacity of its ruling class, and to
reawaken internal political strife. In 118 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> occurred the death of
Micipsa, who had succeeded Masinissa as king of Numidia. Micipsa
left his kingdom to be ruled jointly by his two sons, Adherbal and
Hiempsal, and a nephew, Jugurtha. The latter was an able, energetic,
but ambitious and unscrupulous prince, who had gained a good
knowledge of Roman society through serving in the Roman army before
Numantia. However, the three soon quarreled and divided the
<pb n="133"/><anchor id="Pg133"/>kingdom. It was not long before Jugurtha caused Hiempsal to be
assassinated and drove Adherbal from the country. The latter fled
to Rome to appeal for aid, on the basis of the alliance with Rome
which he had inherited from his ancestors. Thereupon Jugurtha sent
his agents, with well filled purses, to plead his case before the Senate.
So successful was he that a Roman commission appointed to divide
Numidia between himself and Adherbal gave him the western or
richest part of the kingdom. But Jugurtha’s aim was to rule over
the whole of Numidia, and so he provoked Adherbal to war. In
113 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he succeeded in besieging him in his capital, Cirta, which
was defended chiefly by Italians who had settled there for commercial
reasons. Two Roman commissions sent to investigate the situation
succumbed to Jugurtha’s diplomacy, and Cirta was forced to
surrender. Adherbal and all its defenders were put to death.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Rome declares war.</hi> The slaughter of so many Italians raised a
storm in Rome, where the business elements and populace forced the
Senate, which was inclined to wink at Jugurtha’s disregard of its
African settlement, to declare war. In 111 a Roman army under
the consul Bestia invaded Numidia. Again Jugurtha resorted to
bribes and secured terms of peace from the consul after a sham submission.
However, the opponents of the Senate saw through the trick
and forced an investigation. Jugurtha was summoned to come to
Rome under safe conduct to give evidence as to his relations with the
Roman officials in Numidia. He came and contrived to buy the intervention
of two tribunes who prevented his testimony from being
taken. But, relying too much upon his ability to buy immunity
for any action, he ventured to procure the assassination in Rome
itself of a rival claimant to the Numidian throne (110 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). His
friends in the Senate dared protect him no longer and he had to leave
Italy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">A Roman defeat, 109 B. C.</hi> The war reopened but the first
operations ended in the early part of 109 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> with the defeat and
capitulation of a Roman army, which was forced to pass under the
yoke, to be released when its commander consented to a recognition
of Jugurtha’s position and an alliance between him and Rome. In
this shameful episode bribery and treachery had played their part.
The terms were rejected at Rome, and a tribunician proposal to try
those guilty of misconduct with Jugurtha was ratified by the
Assem<pb n="134"/><anchor id="Pg134"/>bly. In the same year the consul Metellus took command in Africa.
One of his officers was Caius Marius. Marius was born of an equestrian
family at <anchor id="corr134"/><corr sic="Arpimum">Arpinum</corr>; he served in the cavalry under Scipio
Aemilianus in the Numantine War; engaged with success in the
handling of state contracts; became tribune in 119, praetor in 116,
and propraetor in Spain in 115 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> He was able and ambitious
and chafed under the disdain with which he as a <q>new man</q> was
treated by the senatorial aristocrats.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Marius, consul: 107 B. C.</hi> Metellus, in contrast to the former
commanders against Jugurtha, was both energetic and honorable. He
began a methodical devastation of Numidia, and forced Jugurtha to
abandon the field and resort to guerilla warfare. He also tried to
stir up disloyalty among the king’s followers. But he failed to kill
or capture the latter, which alone would terminate the war. Hence
when he scornfully refused the request of Marius to be allowed to
return and stand for the consulship in 108, Marius intrigued to get
the command transferred to himself, alleging that Metellus was purposely
prolonging the campaign. Finally, Metellus saw fit to let
him go and he was elected consul for the following year. However,
the Senate, wishing to keep Metellus in command, had not designated
Numidia as a consular province. And so the popular party passed
a law in the Assembly of the Tribes which conferred the command
against Jugurtha upon Marius. The Senate yielded to this encroachment
upon its prerogatives and Marius superseded Metellus in
107. His quaestor was Lucius Cornelius Sulla, scion of a decayed patrician
family, who was destined to become the bitter rival of his chief.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The end of the war: 107–105 B. C.</hi> Marius continued the methodical
subjugation of Numidia, but Jugurtha was strengthened by
an alliance with his father-in-law Bocchus, king of Mauretania.
However, Marius won several hard fought battles over the forces of
both kings, and finally, through the agency of Sulla, detached Bocchus
from the cause of Jugurtha. Bocchus treacherously seized his son-in-law
and handed him over to the Romans. This brought the war
to an end. Numidia was divided among princes friendly to Rome,
and Marius returned to triumph in Rome, and to find himself elected
consul for the year 104 in defiance of precedent, owing to the fear
of a barbarian invasion of Italy from the north and the popular
confidence in him engendered by his African successes. Jugurtha,
after gracing his victor’s triumph, perished in a Roman dungeon.
</p>

<pb n="135"/><anchor id="Pg135"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Consequences of the war.</hi> The corruptibility and incapacity,
combined with an utter lack of public responsibility, displayed by
the senators in this war contributed to further weaken the already
diminished prestige of their order. Besides it had again been demonstrated
that a coalition of the equestrians and the city populace could
control the public policy, and in the person of Marius, the war had
produced a leader upon whom they could unite.

<hi rend="bold">The movements of the Cimbri and Teutons.</hi> The fear of a barbarian
invasion of Italy which caused Marius to be elected to his
second consulship was occasioned by the wanderings of a group of
Germanic and Celtic peoples, chief of which were the Cimbri and the
Teutons. In 113 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the former, a Germanic tribe, invaded the
country of the Taurisci, allies of Rome, who dwelt north of the Alps.
A Roman army sent to the rescue was defeated. The Cimbri then
moved westwards to the Rhine, where they were joined by the Teutons
(Toygeni), who were probably a branch of the Celtic Helvetii,
by the Tigurini, another division of the same people, and by the
Ambrones, a tribe of uncertain origin. In 111, the united peoples
crossed the Rhine into Gaul and came into conflict with the Romans in
the new province. Two years later the consul Julius Silanus was defeated
by the Cimbri, who demanded lands for settlement within
Roman territory. Their demand was refused and hostilities continued.
In 107 another consul, Lucius Cassius, was defeated and
slain by the Tigurini. In 106 Quintus Servilius Caepio recovered
the town of Tolosa, which had deserted the Roman cause, and carried
off its immense temple treasures. Three years later he was tried
and condemned for defrauding the state of this booty. In 105, two
Roman armies were destroyed by the united tribes in a battle at
Arausio (Orange), in which 60,000 Romans were said to have fallen.
This disaster, the greatest suffered by Rome since Cannae, was
largely brought about by friction between the two Roman commanders.
The way to Italy lay open but the barbarians failed to take advantage
of their opportunity. The Cimbri invaded Spain and the rest
remained in Gaul.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The army reforms of Marius.</hi> In this crisis Marius was appointed
to the command against the Cimbri and their allies, and at
<pb n="136"/><anchor id="Pg136"/>once set to work to create an army for the defence of Italy. The increasing
luxury and refinements of civilization in Italy had begun
to undermine the military spirit among the Romans, especially the
propertied classes, and this had led to a decline of discipline and
efficiency in the Roman armies. Furthermore, the universal obligation
to military service was no longer rigidly enforced, partly because
of the residence abroad of so many citizens. Appeals to volunteers
became more and more frequent. No longer were recruits enrolled
for one year only, but took the oath of service for sixteen years. In
building up his new army Marius recognized these new tendencies.
He relied mainly upon voluntary enlistments, admitting to the ranks,
as he had done already in the Jugurthine War, those whose lack of
property had previously disqualified them for service in the legions.
The soldiers now became recognized professionals, who upon their
discharge looked to their commanders to provide for their future.
Among the troops loyalty to the state was supplanted by devotion
to a successful general, and the latter could rely upon his veterans to
support him in his political career. Marius also introduced changes
in the arms and equipment of the soldiers, and he is also credited,
although with less certainty, with the increase in the size of the legion
to 6000 men and its division into ten cohorts as tactical units.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Marius in Gaul.</hi> During the years 104 and 103 Marius kept his
army in Gaul guarding the passage to Italy, while he completed the
training of his troops and dug a new channel at the mouth of the
Rhone to facilitate the passage of his transports into the river. He
was re-elected to the consulship for 103 and again for 102 since the
danger from the barbarians was not over. In 102 the Cimbri returned
from Spain and, joining the other tribes, prepared to invade
Italy. The Teutons and Ambrones followed the direct route from
southern Gaul, while the Cimbri and Tigurini moved to the north
of the Alps to enter Italy by the eastern Alpine passes. Marius permitted
the Teutons and Ambrones to march by him, then he overtook
and annihilated them at Aquae Sextiae. In the meantime, the Cimbri
had forced the other consul, Quintus Lutatius Catulus, to abandon
the defence of the eastern passes and had crossed the Adige into the
Po Valley, where they wintered. Marius returned to Italy to join
his colleague and face the new peril. In the next year, while consul
for the fifth time, he met and destroyed the Cimbri on the Raudine
plains near Vercellae. Thus Italy was saved from a repetition of
<pb n="137"/><anchor id="Pg137"/>the Gallic invasion of the fourth century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
The vitality of the Roman state was by no means exhausted as
the defeat of the barbarians shows, and men of energy and ability
were not lacking, but under the existing régime it required a crisis
to bring them to the front.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Second Sicilian Slave War, 104–101 B. C.</hi> While the
barbarians were knocking at the gates of Italy, Rome was
called upon to suppress a series of disorders in other parts of
her empire, some of which were only quelled after considerable effort.
In 104 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> occurred a serious rebellion of the slaves in Sicily, headed
by two leaders Salvius and Anthenion, the former of whom took
the title of King Typhon. The rebels became masters of the open
country, defeated the forces sent against them, reduced the Sicilian
cities to the verge of starvation, and were only subdued by a consular
army under Manius <anchor id="corr137"/><corr sic="Aequilius">Aquillius</corr> in 101 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">War with the Pirates.</hi> Before the slave war in Sicily had been
brought to a close the Romans were forced to make an effort to suppress
piracy in the Mediterranean. Piracy had been on the increase
ever since the decline of the Rhodian sea power, following
the Second Macedonian War, for as there were no longer any rival
maritime powers Rome had neglected to maintain a navy adequate
even for policing the seas. The pirates were at the same time slave
traders, who made a business of kidnapping all over the Mediterranean
but particularly in the east to supply the slave mart at
Delos. In 104 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the king of Bithynia complained to the Senate
that one-half of his ablebodied men had been carried into slavery.
This traffic was winked at by the Romans, since they needed slaves
in great numbers for their plantations, and their business interests
profited by the trade. However the depredations of the pirates at
length became too serious to be ignored, and in 102 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the praetor
Marcus Antonius was given a special command against them. They
had their chief strongholds on the Cilician coast and the island of
Crete, and Antonius proceeded to Cilicia, where he destroyed several
of their towns and annexed some territory, which became the province
of Cilicia.
</p>

<p>
Besides these troubles the Romans had to face revolts in Spain
which broke out spasmodically down to 95 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, as well as continual
inroads of barbarians from Thrace into the provinces of Macedonia
and Illyricum.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Popular <anchor id="corr138a"/><corr sic="Triumphs">triumphs</corr> in Rome.</hi> The successes of their champion,
Marius, emboldened the populares to undertake the prosecution
of the corrupt and incapable generals of the <hi rend="italic">optimates</hi>, a number
of whom were brought to trial and convicted. Another popular
victory was won in 104 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> when the <hi rend="italic">lex Domitia</hi> transferred the
election of new members of the colleges of augurs and pontiffs from
the colleges themselves to a Comitia of seventeen tribes chosen by
lot.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The sixth consulship of Marius, 100 B. C.</hi> Upon Marius
himself his present prestige had an unwholesome effect. In spite
of the fact that he had violated the constitution by his five consulships,
four of which were held in succession, he determined to seek
a sixth term, although there was now no military danger to excuse
his ambition. He leagued himself with the leaders of the <hi rend="italic">populares</hi>,
Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, who as tribune had supported
Marius in 103, and Caius Servilius Glaucia. Both were ambitious
demagogues, who sought to imitate the rôle of the Gracchi by introducing
a legislative program catering to the popular party. For
the moment they were successful. Marius secured his sixth consulship
for 100 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Saturninus became tribune a second time,
and Glaucia praetor. But violence had to be resorted to in order
to carry the elections. Saturninus then introduced bills for the
distribution of grain to the city proletariat at much less than half
the market price, for the allotment of the lands in north Italy which
had been ravaged by the Cimbri, and for the founding of colonies
in the provinces. His corn law failed, but the others were forced
through by the aid of the disbanded Marian soldiers. However,
this appeal to mob violence caused the equestrians to desert the
popular leaders, who also lost the sympathy of Marius. Saturninus
then sought the consulship for the next year, and, when it seemed
that he would be defeated, caused one of his most influential rivals
to be killed. The Senate thereupon proclaimed a state of martial
law and called upon Marius to restore order. Saturninus, Glaucia,
and their followers occupied the Capitol, where they were attacked
and forced to surrender upon promise that their lives would be
spared. But Marius was unable to protect them from the
ven<pb n="139"/><anchor id="Pg139"/>geance of their foes who massacred all the captives. Again the
Senate had conquered by a resort to force, but this time their opponents
had first appealed to the same means. For the time Marius
suffered a political eclipse; he had shown no political capacity and
had been unable to control or protect his own party which was now
divided and discredited.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The <anchor id="corr139"/><corr sic="Trial ">trial</corr> of Rutilius Rufus: 93 B. C.</hi> The senators and the
equestrians had combined for the moment against the terrorism instituted
by the popular demagogues but the coalition was not lasting.
As Caius Gracchus had foreseen the control of the law courts
proved a standing bone of contention between the two orders. Especially
aggravating to the senators was the use of the court established
for the trial of cases of extortion to force the provincial
governors to administer the provinces in the interest of the Roman
financiers. A scandalous instance of this abuse was the case of
Rutilius Rufus in 93 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> He had been quaestor under Mucius
Scaevola, in 98 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> governor of Asia, where both had sternly
checked any unjust exactions by the agents of the <hi rend="italic">publicani</hi>. A
trumped-up charge of extortion was now brought against Rutilius, and
he was tried and adjudged guilty. His fate was to serve as a warning
to officers who took their provincial obligations seriously. Rutilius
retired to Asia and lived in great esteem among the people whom
he was condemned for having oppressed.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The <anchor id="corr139a"/><corr sic="Legislative Program">legislative program</corr> of Livius Drusus: 91 B. C.</hi> Two
years later Marcus Livius Drusus, a tribune, of a prominent senatorial
house, brought forward a proposal for the reform of the
juries. He proposed to increase the number of the Senate to six
hundred by the inclusion of three hundred prominent equestrians,
and to have the juries chosen half from the new Senate and half
from the remaining equestrians.<note place="foot">Seymour, P. A., <hi rend="italic">English Historical Review</hi>, 1914, pp. 417 ff.</note> Equestrian <hi rend="italic">jurors</hi> were to be made
liable to prosecution for accepting bribes. To secure support for
his judiciary law, Drusus introduced a bill to found new colonies
and another to provide cheaper grain for the city populace.
</p>

<p>
However, when he encountered serious opposition to his judicial
<pb n="140"/><anchor id="Pg140"/>reform in the Senate as well as among the <hi rend="italic">equites</hi>, Drusus combined
this and his other reforms with a law for the enfranchisement of
the Italian allies. He contrived to carry his measures through the
Assembly, which was probably coerced by the presence of large
numbers of Italians in the city, but since he had included several
distinct proposals in one bill, which was unconstitutional, the Senate
declared his law invalid. Drusus yielded but prepared to introduce
the franchise bill to be voted on a second time. Before this could
be done he was mysteriously assassinated, doubtless by an agent
of his political opponents. Thus died the last civilian reformer of
Roman history. Later reforms were carried by the power of the
sword.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Italian Confederacy.</hi> The death of Drusus was the signal
for a revolt of the Italian allies. They had been in close alliance
with him, and had taken steps for concerted action in arms if his
bill should fail to pass. A confederacy was organized, the government
of which was vested in a Senate of five hundred members
with absolute powers, having as executive officers two annual consuls
and twelve praetors. The capital of the confederacy was at
Corfinium, in the territory of the Paeligni, which was renamed
Italia. A federal coinage was issued. Before opening hostilities
the Italians made a formal demand for Roman citizenship, which the
Senate definitely refused. Thereupon they declared their independence.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The resources of the rivals.</hi> The Italian Confederacy embraced
practically all the warlike peoples of central and southern
Italy. Of particular importance were the Marsi who gave their
name to the war. In numbers the Italians were a match for the
Romans, and they had acquired Roman military tactics, organization
and discipline through long service in the Roman armies. They
also could count on leaders of approved ability. But the Latin
colonies and the Greek cities in the south remained true to their
allegiance, and thus the Italians were cut off from the coast. Furthermore
Umbria and Etruria, although disaffected, did not at once
take up arms. Rome’s control of the sea enabled her to draw upon
the resources of the provinces in men, money, and supplies, and
<pb n="141"/><anchor id="Pg141"/>consequently she was in a much better position to sustain a prolonged
struggle.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The first year of the war: 90 B. C.</hi> Hostilities opened in 90
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> with the Italian forces attempting to reach Etruria in the north
and occupy Campania in the south and the Romans trying to forestall
them by invading the territory of the allies. In the south
the year’s campaign resulted in numerous Roman disasters. Much
of Campania was won by the allies who succeeded in penetrating
to the coast. In the north the Romans also suffered defeats, but
were able to maintain themselves and win several successes. Here
Marius, in the capacity of a <hi rend="italic">legatus</hi>, rendered valuable service.
</p>

<p>
Before the close of the year the revolt began to spread to Etruria
and Umbria. Thereupon the Romans, with the object of securing
the support of their still faithful allies and of weakening the ranks
of the rebels, passed the Julian Law which granted Roman citizenship
to all who had not joined the revolt and all who should at once
lay down their arms. In this way the Umbrians and Etrurians were
quieted, the Latins and the Greek allies rewarded, and many communities,
which sought Roman citizenship but not independence, induced
to surrender.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The second year of the war.</hi> In the following year the fortune
of war changed. The Romans were everywhere successful.
The consul Pompeius practically pacified the north, and the <hi rend="italic">legatus</hi>
Sulla broke the power of the allies in south Italy. A second
franchise law, the <hi rend="italic">lex Plautia Papiria</hi>, helped thin the ranks of the
allies by offering Roman citizenship to all citizens of Italian federate
communities who would claim it within sixty days. A third, the
Pompeian Law, gave the franchise to all non-Romans in Gaul south
of the Po, and Latin rights to those north of the Po river. The
Senate was now anxious to bring the war to a close because affairs
in the East had assumed a threatening aspect.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The end of the war and its significance.</hi> In the course of the
year 88 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> organized resistance among the rebels died out. The
new citizens were not to be enrolled in all of the thirty-five Roman
tribes, a step which might make them dominate the Assemblies, but
they were to vote in certain tribes only, so that their influence could
be restricted.<note place="foot">The details of this arrangement have not been preserved; for a suggestion see
Heitland, <hi rend="italic">Roman Republic</hi>, II, pp. 447 ff.</note> Naturally, they were dissatisfied with this
    arrange<pb n="142"/><anchor id="Pg142"/>ment and their enrollment became a burning question of Roman
politics. Henceforth all Italians were Romans and in the course of
the next generation the various racial elements of Italy were gradually
welded into a Latin nation. As it was impossible for the magistrates
of Rome to oversee the administration throughout so wide an
area, the Romans organized the Italian towns into locally self-governing
municipalities of the type previously established on Roman territory.
At first these municipalities retained many of their ancestral
laws, customs and institutions, but in time they conformed to a uniform
type, the government of which was modelled upon that of the
capital city Rome. The municipalities were powerful agents in the
Latinization of the peninsula.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Mithradates VI., Eupator, King of Pontus.</hi> The danger which
in 89 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> directed the attention of the Senate to the eastern Mediterranean
was the result of the establishment of the Kingdom of Pontus
under an able and ambitious ruler, Mithradates Eupator, who challenged
the supremacy of Rome in Asia Minor. In 121 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Mithradates
had succeeded to the throne of northern Cappadocia, a small
kingdom on the south shore of the Black Sea, whose Asiatic population
was imbued with Hellenistic culture and whose rulers claimed
descent from the ancient royal house of Persia and from Seleucus,
the founder of the Macedonian kingdom of Syria. For seven years
Mithradates shared the throne with his brother, under his mother’s
regency, but in 114 when eighteen years of age, he seized the reins
of government for himself. Subsequently he extended his power over
the eastern and northern shores of the Black Sea as far west as the
Danube and thus built up the kingdom of Pontus, i. e. the coast
land of the Black Sea, a name which later was applied to his
native state of north Cappadocia.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">His <anchor id="corr142"/><corr sic="Conflict">conflict</corr> with Rome.</hi> However, Mithradates also sought to
extend his sway in Asia Minor, where Greater Cappadocia became
the object of his ambitions. This brought him into conflict with
Rome, whose policy was to prevent the rise of any dangerous neighbor
in the East and who refused to suffer her settlement of Asia
Minor to be disturbed. No less than five times did Mithradates,
between 112 and 92 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, attempt to bring this district under his
<pb n="143"/><anchor id="Pg143"/>control, but upon each occasion he was forced by Roman interference
to forego the fruits of his victories, since he was not yet prepared
for war with Rome. In 91 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he occupied the kingdom of Bithynia,
which lay between Pontus and the Roman province of Asia,
but again he yielded to Rome’s demands and withdrew. However,
when Roman agents encouraged the King of Bithynia to raid his
territory and refused him satisfaction he decided to challenge the
Roman arms, seeing that Rome was now involved in the war with
her Italian allies. War began late in 89 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The conquests of Mithradates in Asia, 89–88 B. C.</hi> Mithradates
was well prepared; he had a trained army and a fleet of three
hundred ships. He experienced no difficulty in defeating the local
levies raised by the Roman governor of Asia, and speedily overran
Bithynia and most of the Roman province. Meanwhile his fleet
swept the Aegean Sea. The Roman provincials who had been unmercifully
exploited by tax gatherers and money-lenders greeted
Mithradates as a deliverer. At his order on a set date in 88 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
they massacred the Romans and Italians resident in Asia, said to
have numbered 80,000, a step which bound them firmly to the cause
of the king.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Athens and Delos.</hi> In the same year, 88 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the populace of
Athens, in the hope of overthrowing the oligarchic government which
had been set up in the city with the support of Rome, seized control
of the state and threw themselves into the hands of Mithradates.
One of the king’s generals, Archelaus, while on his way to Athens,
exterminated the Italian colony at Delos, the center of the Roman
commercial and banking interests in the East. From this blow the
island port never fully recovered. Archelaus soon won over most
of southern Greece to his master’s cause, while Mithradates sent a
large army to enter Hellas by the northerly route through Thrace
and Macedonia.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Disorders in Rome.</hi> This situation produced a crisis in Rome.
Sulla, who had been elected consul for 88 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, was allotted the
command in the East upon the outbreak of hostilities. However,
he had been unable to leave Italy where he was conducting the siege
of Nola in Campania. Marius, although in his sixty-eighth year,
was as ambitious as ever and schemed to secure the command against
Mithradates for himself. In this he was supported by the equestrians,
who knew Sulla to be a firm upholder of the Senate.
Accord<pb n="144"/><anchor id="Pg144"/>ingly the Marians joined forces with the tribune Publius Sulpicius
Rufus, who had brought forward a bill to enroll the new citizens
and freedmen equally in each of the thirty-five tribes. Sulpicius
organized a body-guard of equestrians and instituted a reign of terror.
He passed his law by force in spite of the opposition of the consuls.
When Sulla had left the city to join his army, a law was passed
in the Assembly transferring his command in the East to Marius.
But Sulla refused to admit the legality of the act, and, relying upon
the support of his troops, marched on Rome. Having taken the city
by surprise, he caused Sulpicius, Marius, and others of their party
to be outlawed. Sulpicius was slain; but Marius made good his
escape to Mauretania. The Sulpician Laws were abrogated, and
Sulla introduced a number of reforms, with the object of strengthening
the position of the Senate. The most significant of these
reforms was the revival of the Senatorial veto over laws proposed
in the Assembly of the Tribes. This done, upon the conclusion of his
consulate, Sulla embarked with his army for Greece early in 87 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Siege of Athens and Piraeus, 87–86 B. C.</hi> Driving the forces
of Archelaus and the Athenians from the open country, Sulla began
the siege of Athens and of its harbor town Piraeus in the autumn
of 87. Athens was completely invested, but in spite of hunger the
resistance was prolonged until March, 86, when Sulla’s troops penetrated
an unguarded spot on the walls and the city was sacked. A
large number of the inhabitants were massacred but the public
buildings were spared. Soon after Piraeus was taken by storm
at terrific cost to the victors, but its citadel Munychia held out until
evacuated by Archelaus.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Chaeronea and Orchomenus.</hi> From Athens Sulla hastened to
meet the army of Mithradates which had penetrated as far as
Boeotia. At Chaeronea the numerically inferior but better disciplined
Romans won a complete victory. At this juncture there
arrived in Greece the consul Flaccus at the head of another army,
with orders to supersede Sulla. The latter, however, was not disposed
to give up his command and as Flaccus feared to force the
issue they came to an agreement whereby each pursued a separate
campaign. This left Sulla free to meet a new Mithradatic army
which had crossed the Aegean. At Orchomenus he attacked and
annihilated it. But Mithradates still controlled the Aegean, and
Sulla, being unable to cross into Asia, was forced to winter in Greece.
</p>

<pb n="145"/><anchor id="Pg145"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Peace with Mithradates, 85 B. C.</hi> In 85 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Lucius Lucullus,
Sulla’s quaestor, appeared in the Aegean with a fleet that he had
gathered among Rome’s allies in the East. He defeated the fleet
of Mithradates and secured Sulla’s passage to Asia. The king’s
position was now precarious. His exactions had alienated the sympathies
of the Greek cities which now began to desert his cause.
Furthermore Flaccus, after recovering Macedonia and Thrace, had
crossed the Bosphorus into Bithynia. There he was killed in a mutiny
of his soldiers and was succeeded by his legate Fimbria, who was
popular with the troops because he gratified their desire for plunder.
But Fimbria was energetic; he defeated Mithradates and recovered
the coast district as far south as Pergamon (86 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). Mithradates
was ready for peace and Sulla was anxious to have his hands free
to return to Italy, where the Marians were again in power. Negotiations
were opened by Mithradates with Sulla and after some delay
peace was concluded in 85 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> on the following terms: The king
was to surrender Cappadocia, Bithynia, the Roman province of Asia
and his other conquests in Asia Minor, to pay an indemnity of
3000 talents, and give up a part of his fleet. His kingdom of
Pontus remained intact.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Sulla’s treatment of Asia and Greece, 85–83 B. C.</hi> Sulla spent
the following winter in Asia, readjusting affairs in the province.
The rebellious communities were punished by the quartering of troops
upon them, and by being forced to contribute to Sulla the huge sum
of 20,000 talents, or $24,000,000. To raise this amount they were
forced to borrow from Roman bankers and incur a crushing burden
of debt. In 84 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Sulla crossed to Greece, there to complete his
preparations for a return to Italy. The Greek states had suffered
heavily in the recent campaigns on her soil. Sulla had carried off
the temple treasures of Olympia, Delphi and Epidaurus, Attica and
Boeotia had been ravaged and depopulated, and the coasts had
been raided by the Mithradatic fleet. From the devastations of the
Mithradatic war Hellas never recovered.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Marian party in Rome 87–84 B. C.</hi> While Sulla had been
conducting his successful campaign in Greece, in Italy the Marian
party had again won the upper hand. Scarcely had Sulla left Italy
<pb n="146"/><anchor id="Pg146"/>with his army when the consul Cinna re-enacted the Sulpician Laws.
His colleague Gnaeus Octavius and the senatorial faction drove
him from the city and had him deposed from office. But Cinna received
the support of the army in Campania, recalled Marius, and
made peace with the Samnites still under arms by granting them
Roman citizenship. Marius landed in Etruria, raised an army there,
and he and Cinna advanced on Rome. They forced the capitulation
of their opponents, had Cinna reinstated as consul, and had the
banishment of Marius revoked; Sulla’s laws were repealed, and his
property confiscated. Then ensued a massacre of the leading senators,
including Octavius the consul. On 1 January, 86, Marius
entered upon his seventh consulship and died a few days later.
His successor, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, was sent to supersede Sulla,
a mission which cost him his life, as related before. In 85 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>,
the war with Mithradates was at an end and the Marians had to
face the prospect of the return of Sulla at the head of a victorious
army. The consuls Cinna and Carbo proceeded to raise troops to
oppose him. They illegally prolonged their office for the next year
(84) and made preparations to cross the Adriatic and meet Sulla in
Macedonia. But the army gathered for this purpose at Brundisium
mutinied and murdered Cinna. Carbo prevented the election of a
successor and held office as sole consul. The Senate had previously
begun negotiations with Sulla in an effort to prevent further civil
war. He now demanded the restitution of property and honors
both for himself and all those who had taken refuge with him. The
Senate was inclined to yield, but was prevented by Carbo.
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 83 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Sulla landed at Brundisium, with an
army of 40,000 veterans from whom he exacted an oath of allegiance
to himself. He made known his intentions of respecting all privileges
granted to the Italians, to prevent their joining his enemies.
Still the bulk of the new citizens, particularly in Samnium and
Etruria, supported the Marian party. Sulla was joined at once by
the young Cnaeus Pompey, who had raised an army on his own
authority in Picenum, and by other men of influence. In the operations
which followed the leaders of the Marians showed themselves
lacking in coöperation and military skill. Sulla penetrated into Campania,
where he defeated one consul Norbanus, at Mount Tifata.
The other consul Scipio Asiaticus, entered into negotiations with him,
and was deserted by his army which went over to Sulla.
</p>

<pb n="147"/><anchor id="Pg147"/>

<p>
In the following year Sulla advanced into Latium and won a hard
fought victory over the younger Marius, now consul, at Sacriportus.
Rome fell into his hands and Marius took refuge in Praeneste.
Sulla then turned against the second consul, Carbo, in Etruria, and,
after several victories forced him to flee to Africa. In a final
effort the Marians, united with the Samnites, tried to relieve Praeneste;
failing to accomplish this they made a dash upon Rome. But
Sulla appeared in time to save the city and utterly defeat his enemies
in a bloody contest at the Colline Gate. Praeneste fell soon after;
Marius committed suicide, and except at a few isolated points all resistance
in Italy was over.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Sulla’s aims.</hi> Sulla was absolute master of the situation and at
once proceeded to punish his enemies and reward his friends. In
cold-blooded cruelty, without any legal condemnation, his leading opponents
were marked out for vengeance; their names were posted in
lists in the forum to indicate that they might be slain with impunity
and that their goods were confiscated. Rewards were offered to informers
who brought about the death of such victims, and many were
included in the lists to gratify the personal enmities of Sulla’s friends.
The goods of the proscribed were auctioned off publicly under Sulla’s
direction, and their children and grandchildren declared ineligible for
public office. From these proscriptions the equestrians suffered particularly;
2600 of them are said to have perished, together with ninety
senators. The Italian municipalities also felt Sulla’s avenging hand.
Widespread confiscations of land, especially in Samnium and Etruria,
enabled him to provide for 150,000 of his veterans, whose settlement
did much to hasten the latinization of these districts. Ten thousand
slaves of the proscribed were set free by Sulla and took the name of
Cornelii from their patron. These arrangements were given the sanction
of legality by a decree of the Senate and a law which confirmed
all his acts as consul and proconsul and gave him full power for the
future.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Sulla dictator: 82–79 B. C.</hi> But Sulla’s aims went further than
the destruction of the Marian party. He sought to recreate a stable
government in the state. For this he required more constitutional
powers than the right of might. Therefore, since both consuls were
dead, he caused the appointment of an <hi rend="italic">interrex</hi> who by virtue of a
special law appointed him a dictator for an unlimited term to enact
legislation and reorganize the commonwealth (<hi rend="italic">dictator legibus
    scri<pb n="148"/><anchor id="Pg148"/>bundis et rei publicae constituendae</hi>). Sulla’s appointment occurred
late in 82 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> The scope of his powers and their unlimited duration
gave him monarchical or rather tyrannical authority.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Sulla’s reforms.</hi> The general aim of Sulla’s legislation was to
restore the Senate to the position which it had held prior to 133 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
and to guarantee the perpetuation of this condition. His reforms fall
into two classes; firstly, those directed to securing the rule of the
<hi rend="italic">optimates</hi>, which were not long-lived; secondly, those seeking to increase
the efficiency of the administration, which being of a non-partizan
character enjoyed greater permanency than the preceding.
Those of the former sort constituted a renewal and extension of his
reforms of 88 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> The senatorial veto over legislation in the Assembly
of Tribes was renewed, and the tribunes’ intercession restricted to
interference with the exercise of the magistrate’s <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>. To deter
able and ambitious men from seeking the tribunate, it was made a bar
to further political office. The senators were once more made eligible
for the juries, while the equestrians were disqualified. The Domitian
Law of 104 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> was abrogated and the practise of co-opting the members
of the priestly college was revived. Most important of Sulla’s
administrative reforms was that which concerned the magistracy.
The established order of offices in the <hi rend="italic">cursus honorum</hi> was maintained,
an age limit set for eligibility to each office, and an interval
of ten years required between successive tenures of the same post.
The number of quaestors was increased to twenty, that of the praetors
raised from six to eight. In connection therewith the method of appointing
provincial governors was regulated. By the organization of
the province of Cisalpine Gaul, the number of provinces was raised
to ten, and the two consuls and eight praetors, upon the completion of
their year of office in Rome, were to be appointed to the provinces as
pro-consuls and propraetors for one year. The pro-magistrates thus
lost their original extraordinary character and this change marks the
first step in the creation of an imperial civil service.
</p>

<p>
As before, the Senate designated the consular provinces before the
election of the consuls who would be their proconsular governors.
The consuls were not deprived of the right of military command, but,
as before, regularly assumed control of military operations in Italy.
The consular <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> remained senior to that of the provincial
governors, and might be exercised beyond the frontiers of Italy. However,
in practise the consuls were not regularly employed for overseas
<pb n="149"/><anchor id="Pg149"/>campaigns, since the Senate now arrogated to itself what had previously
been a prerogative of the Assembly, namely, the right of selecting
any person whatever to exercise military <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> in any sphere
determined by itself. A new field for the activity of the praetors
arose from the establishment of special jury courts for the trial of
cases of bribery, treason, fraud, peculation, assassination and assault
with violence. These were modelled on the court for damage suits
brought against provincial officers, and superseded the old procedure
with its appeal from the verdict of the magistrate to the Comitia. To
provide a sufficient number of jurors for these tribunals the membership
of the Senate was increased from three hundred to six hundred
by enrolling equestrians who had supported Sulla. This increased
number was maintained by the annual admission of the
twenty ex-quaestors, whereby censors were rendered unnecessary for
enrolling the Senators. The administration, especially in its imperial
aspects, was more than ever concentrated in the Senate’s hands.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Pompey <q>the Great,</q> 79 B. C.</hi> While Sulla was effecting his
settlement of affairs in Rome and Italy, the Marians in Sicily and
Africa were crushed by his lieutenant Cnaeus Pompey. Their leader
Carbo was taken and executed. In 82 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Sulla had caused the
Senate to confer upon Pompey the command in this campaign with
the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> of a propraetor, although he had not yet held any public
office. Having finished his task Pompey demanded a triumph, an
honor which previously had only been granted to regular magistrates.
Sulla at first opposed his wishes, but as Pompey was insistent and defiant,
he yielded to avoid a quarrel, and even accorded him the name of
Magnus or the Great. Pompey celebrated his triumph 12 March,
79 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Sulla’s retirement and death, 78 B. C.</hi> Sulla did not seek political
power for its own sake, and, after carrying his reforms into effect,
he resigned his dictatorship in 79 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> He retired to enjoy a life
of ease and pleasure on his Campanian estate, relying for his personal
security and that of his measures upon his veterans and the Cornelian
freedmen. In the following year he died at the age of sixty. Sulla’s
genius was rather military than political. Fond though he was of
sensual pleasures, he was possessed of great ambition which led him
to such a position of prominence that he was forced to adopt the cause
of one of the two political factions in the state. From that point he
must crush his enemies or be crushed by them; and in this lies the
<pb n="150"/><anchor id="Pg150"/>explanation of his attempt to extirpate the Marian party. As a
statesman he displayed little imagination or constructive ability. He
could think of nothing better than to restore the Senate to a position
which it had shown itself unable to maintain; and his persecutions
of his political opponents had not crushed out opposition to the Senate,
but left a legacy of hatred endangering the permanence of his
reforms.
</p>

<p>
The epoch between the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus and the
death of Sulla revealed the incapacity of either the Senate or the
tribunes and the Assembly to give a peaceful and stable government
to the Roman state. Sulla’s career, anticipating those of Caesar and
Augustus, pointed the way to the ultimate solution.

<head type="sub">CHAPTER XIII</head>

<head>THE RISE OF POMPEY THE GREAT: 78–60 B. C.</head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The extraordinary commands.</hi> For the period following the
death of Sulla in 78 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Roman history centers around the lives of
a small group of eminent men, whose ambitions and rivalries are the
determining factors in the political life of the state. This is due to
the fact that neither the Senate nor the Assembly have the power to
control the men to whom the needs of the empire compel them to give
military authority. The generation of Marius and Sulla had seen the
rise of the professional army which revealed itself as the true power
in the state, and the disturbances of the Italian and Civil Wars supplied
an abundance of needy recruits who sought service with a
popular and successful general for the sake of the rewards which it
lay in his power to bestow. As military achievements were the sole
sure foundation for political success, able men made it the goal of
their ambition to be entrusted with an important military command.
The dangers of civil and foreign wars at first compelled the Senate
to confer military power upon the few available men of recognized
ability even when it distrusted their ulterior motives, and later such
appointments were made by the Assembly through the coalition of the
general and the tribunate. In this way arose the so-called extraordinary
commands, that is, such as involved a military <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> which
in some way exceeded that of the regular constitutional officers and
required to be created or defined by a special enactment of the Senate
or Comitia.
</p>

<p>
The man who first realized the value of the extraordinary command
as a path to power was Pompey the Great.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">I. Pompey’s Command against Sertorius in Spain:
77–71 b. c.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The revolt of Lepidus.</hi> It was not to be expected that Sulla’s
measures would long remain unassailed. Those dispossessed of their
<pb n="152"/><anchor id="Pg152"/>property, those disqualified for office, and the equestrians who sought
to regain control of the courts, were all anxious to undo part of his
work. They found a leader in Lepidus, who as consul in 78 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, the
very year of Sulla’s death, sought to renew the distribution of cheap
grain to the masses in Rome, which Sulla had suppressed, to restore
the Marian exiles, and reinstate those who had lost their lands. For
the time he failed to carry his proposals, but in the next year, as
proconsul of Cisalpine Gaul, he raised an army and marched on
Rome to seize the consulate for a second term, since disorders had
prevented the election of consuls for that year. However he was defeated
by his former colleague, the proconsul Catulus, and Pompey,
whom the Senate had appointed to a subordinate command in view
of his military expedience. Lepidus crossed over to Sardinia where
he died shortly after, and the bulk of his forces under Marcus Perperna
withdrew to Spain, to join the Marians who were in revolt
there.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Sertorius in Spain, 83–78 B. C.</hi> The rebellion in Spain was
headed by Quintus Sertorius, who had been appointed governor of
Hither Spain by Cinna in 83 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Two years later he was driven
out by Sulla’s representative, but, after various adventures, returned
in 80 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> to head a revolt of the Lusitanians. His ability as a
guerrilla leader, and the confidence which he aroused among the native
Spaniards soon created alarm in Rome. Sertorius professed to
take the field not against Rome but against the Senate. He regarded
himself as the legitimate governor of Spain, employed members of
the Marian party as his military and civil subordinates and organized
a Senate among the Romans of his following. To crush the revolt
Sulla sent out to Farther Spain Metellus, the consul of 80 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, but
he failed to make any headway, and Sertorius was able to overrun
Hither Spain also. In 79 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the praetor of that province was
killed in battle, and the same fate befell the proconsul of Narbonese
Gaul who came to the help of Metellus (78 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Pompey sent to Spain, 78 B. C.</hi> It was imperative to send a
new commander and a new army to Spain. As the consuls were unwilling
to go, Pompey, who had refused to disband his army at the
orders of Catulus, sought the command. The Senate could not help
itself and, in spite of considerable opposition, passed a decree conferring
upon him proconsular <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> and entrusting him with the
conduct of the war in Hither Spain. Even after the arrival of
Pom<pb n="153"/><anchor id="Pg153"/>pey with an army of 40,000 men Sertorius was more than able to hold
his own against his foes in 76 and 75 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> At the end of the latter
year Pompey was forced to recross the Pyrenees and appeal to the
Senate for reinforcements. At the same time Sertorius, through the
agency of the pirates, entered into alliance with Mithradates, King
of Pontus, who was again on the point of war with Rome.
</p>

<p>
The arrival of the desired reinforcements enabled Pompey in 74
and 73 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> to turn the tide against Sertorius. To prevent desertions
the latter resorted to severe punishments which alienated the
Spaniards, who were already estranged by the acts of his subordinates.
He was further hampered by dissensions in the ranks of his Roman
supporters. The center of disaffection was Perpenna, who treacherously
assassinated Sertorius in 72 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> and assumed command of his
forces. However he was defeated by Pompey, taken captive and
executed. The revolt was broken and pacification of Spain speedily
accomplished. Pompey was able to return to Rome in 71 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The situation in the Near East.</hi> After concluding peace with
Sulla in 85 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Mithradates Eupator directed his energies to consolidating
his kingdom and reorganizing his forces in expectation of a
renewal of the struggle with Rome. He recognised that Sulla had
been ready to make peace only because of the situation in Italy and
the fact that he had been unable to secure written confirmation of the
terms of the treaty warned him that the Romans still contemplated his
complete overthrow. Indeed he had been attacked in the years 83
and 82 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> by Lucius Murena, the proconsul of Asia, but had been
able to defend himself and Sulla had once more brought about a
cessation of hostilities. Meantime, Tigranes of Armenia, the ally of
Mithradates, had enlarged his dominions by the annexation of Syria
(83 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>), where he terminated the rule of the house of Seleucus,
and of Greater Cappadocia.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The command of Lucullus and Cotta, 74 B. C.</hi> In 75 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> occurred
the death of Nicomedes III, King of Bithynia, who left his
kingdom to the Roman people. The Senate accepted the inheritance
and made Bithynia a province, but Mithradates championed the
claims of a son of Nicomedes and determined to dispute the
posses<pb n="154"/><anchor id="Pg154"/>sion of Bithynia with the Romans. He had raised an efficient army
and navy, was leagued with the pirates, and in alliance with Sertorius,
who supplied him with officers and recognized his claims to
Bithynia and other districts in Asia Minor. Rome was threatened
with another serious war. One of the senatorial faction, the consul
Lucius Lucullus, contrived to have assigned to himself by a senatorial
decree the provinces of Cilicia and Asia with command of the
main operations against Mithradates, while his colleague Cotta received
Bithynia and a fleet to guard the Hellespont. At the same
time a praetor, Marcus Antonius, was given an extraordinary command
against the pirates with an unlimited <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> over the Mediterranean
Sea and its coast. However, he proved utterly incompetent,
was defeated in an attack upon Crete, and died there.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Siege of Cyzicus, 74–3 B. C.</hi> Early in 74 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Mithradates invaded
Bithynia. There he was encountered by Cotta, whom he defeated
and blockaded in Chalcedon. Thereupon he invaded Asia
and laid siege to Cyzicus. But Lucullus cut off his communications
and in the ensuing winter he was forced to raise the siege and retire
with heavy losses into Bithynia. The following year a fleet which
Lucullus had raised defeated that of Mithradates. This enabled the
Romans to recover Bithynia and invade Pontus. In 72 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Lucullus
defeated Mithradates and forced him to take refuge in Armenia. In
the course of this and the two following years he completed the subjugation
of Pontus by the systematic reduction of its fortified cities.
Cotta undertook the siege of Heraclea in Bithynia and upon its fall
in 71 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> returned to Rome. The winter of 71–70 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Lucullus
spent in Asia reorganizing the financial situation. There the cities
were laboring under a frightful burden of indebtedness to Roman
bankers and taxgatherers which had its origin in the exactions of
Sulla. Lucullus interfered on behalf of the provincials and by reducing
the accumulated interest on their debts enabled them to pay
off their obligations within four years. This care for the provincials
won for himself the bitter enmity of the Roman financial interests
which sought to deprive him of his command.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Invasion of Armenia, 69 B. C.</hi> As the war could not be regarded
as terminated so long as Mithradates was at large, Lucullus
demanded his surrender from Tigranes. When the latter refused
Lucullus invaded Armenia, defeated him and took his capital, Tigranocerta,
69 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> In the following year Lucullus attempted to
<pb n="155"/><anchor id="Pg155"/>complete the subjugation of Armenia but was prevented by the mutinous
conduct of his troops. He was unpopular with his men because
he maintained discipline and protected the subject peoples from the
excesses of the soldiers. Also some of his legions had come to the
East with Fimbria in 86 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> and clamored for the discharge to
which they were entitled. In 67 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Mithradates reappeared in
Pontus and Lucullus had to return from Armenia to face him, whereupon
Tigranes began to recover lost ground. Because of the mutiny
in his army Lucullus was forced to remain inactive. He had already
been superseded in the command of Asia, Cilicia and Bithynia, which
had come under his control with the return of Cotta, and his enemies
in Rome deprived him of the remnants of his authority in 66 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. The Revolt of the Gladiators: 73–71 b. c.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Spartacus.</hi> While Pompey was fighting Sertorius in Spain and
Lucullus was pursuing Mithradates in Bithynia a serious slave war
arose in Italy. It began in 73 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> with the revolt of a band of
gladiators from a training school in Capua under the leadership of
the Thracian Spartacus and the Gauls, Crixus and Onemaus. Taking
refuge on the slopes of Vesuvius they rapidly recruited large numbers
of runaway slaves. They defeated the armies of two Roman
praetors and overran Campania, Lucania, and all southern Italy.
By the end of the year 73 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> their number had grown to 70,000.
</p>

<p>
In the next year they divided their forces; the Gauls and Germans
followed Crixus, the Thracians Spartacus. The two consuls took the
field against them; Crixus and his horde were defeated in Apulia.
Spartacus marched north, intending to make his way through the Alps
to Thrace. The consuls pursued him, and he defeated them one after
the other. Thereupon his followers refused to leave Italy and turned
southwards, plundering as they went. Again Spartacus defeated the
consuls but dared not attack Rome and retired to South Italy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Crassus in command, 71 B. C.</hi> In 71 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the consuls displayed
no enthusiasm to undertake the command against Spartacus, and so
the Senate appointed as extraordinary commander the praetor Marcus
Licinius Crassus, one of Sulla’s veteran officers, who volunteered his
services. After restoring discipline among his troops, Crassus succeeded
in penning up Spartacus in the peninsula of Bruttium. Spartacus
hired some Cilician pirates to transport him to Sicily, but, after
<pb n="156"/><anchor id="Pg156"/>receiving their price, they abandoned him to his fate. He succeeded
in breaking through Crassus’ lines, but his forces divided into two
detachments, each of which was caught and beaten. Spartacus fell
in battle; while 6000 of his following were taken and crucified.
Crassus had bent all his energies to bring the revolt to a close before
the arrival of Pompey, who was on his way from Spain. This he
might fairly claim to have accomplished although a body of 5000
slaves who had escaped to North Italy were met by Pompey and
annihilated.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Pompey and Crassus consuls.</hi> Both Pompey and Crassus,
flushed by their victories in Spain and in Italy, now demanded the
right to stand for the consulship for 70 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Both sought triumphs
and under this pretext did not disband their armies. The Senate resisted
their claims, for Pompey’s candidature was clearly unconstitutional,
and since Crassus was praetor in 71 he was not eligible for
the consulate in the following year. Furthermore both were distrusted
because of their ambitious natures. In view of this opposition Crassus,
in spite of mutual jealousy between himself and Pompey, made
overtures to the latter and they agreed to unite their forces. They
also made a bid for the support of the <hi rend="italic">populares</hi> by promising to restore
the tribunate to its former privileges and for that of the equestrians
by promising to reinstate them in the jury courts. This combination
overawed senatorial opposition, their candidatures were
legalized by special bills and both were elected. In their consulate
the tribunes were relieved of the restrictions which Sulla had placed
upon their activities, and the jury courts were reorganized. However,
the latter were not given over completely to the equestrians, but each
panel of jurors was to consist of three equal sections, one drawn from
the Senate, one from the <hi rend="italic">equites</hi>, and one from the <hi rend="italic">tribuni aerarii</hi>, the
class of citizens whose assessment was next to that of the <hi rend="italic">equites</hi>.
The Sullan régime was at an end, and in the tribunate emancipated
from the Senate’s control the ambitious general of the future was to
find his most valuable ally.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Trial of Verres.</hi> In the same year, prior to the passing of the
Aurelian Law which reformed the juries, occurred the trial of Caius
Verres, ex-propraetor of Sicily, a case notable because the
prosecu<pb n="157"/><anchor id="Pg157"/>tion was conducted by the young Marcus Tullius Cicero, whose accusation
contained in his published <hi rend="italic">Orations against Caius Verres</hi> constitutes
a most illuminating commentary upon provincial misgovernment
under the Sullan régime. The senatorial juries after 82 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>,
had protected the interests of the provinces no better than had the
equestrian juries established by Caius Gracchus. They had shown
themselves shamelessly venal, and a provincial governor who made
judicious disbursements could be confident that he would be acquitted
of any charges of extortion brought against him. Relying upon this
Verres, who was propraetor of Sicily in 73, 72 and 71 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, had
carried off from that province money and valuables estimated at
40,000,000 sesterces ($2,000,000). He had openly boasted that he
intended the profits of one year for himself, those of the second for
his friends and patrons, and those of the third for his jurors. At the
opening of the year 70 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the Sicilian cities sued Verres for restitution
of damages and chose Cicero as their advocate. Cicero was a
native of Arpinum, the birthplace of Marius, and was now in his
thirty-sixth year. His upright conduct as quaestor in western Sicily
in 75 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> had earned him the confidence of the Sicilians, and his
successful conduct of the defense in several previous trials had marked
him as a pleader of exceptional ability. But Verres had entrusted his
case to Quintus Hortensius Hortalus, regarded at the time as the
foremost of Roman orators, and every conceivable device was resorted
to in order to prevent the case from coming to trial. Another prosecutor
appeared, who claimed to have a better right than Cicero to
bring suit against Verres. This necessitated a trial to decide which
could better claim to represent the Sicilians. Cicero was able to expose
the falsity of the claims of his rival, who was acting in collusion
with Verres. He then proceeded to Sicily where he gathered his evidence
in fifty of the hundred and ten days allowed him for the purpose.
Before the hearing the elections for the next year were held
and Hortensius elected consul, but Cicero was returned as aedile in
spite of all the efforts of his opponents to weaken his prestige by a
defeat at the polls.
</p>

<p>
The trial was set for the fifth of August, and as there were fifty
holidays for various festivals between that date and the end of the
year, the defense hoped to drag out the trial until after January first,
when a praetor friendly to Verres would preside over the court for
extortion. But Cicero defeated their hopes by abstaining from any
<pb n="158"/><anchor id="Pg158"/>long formal speech of accusation and contenting himself with a brief
statement of the obstacles the defense had placed in his way, a threat
to punish in his capacity of aedile any attempts at corruption, and
a short statement of the charge against Verres. He then called his
witnesses. Hortensius found himself without any arguments to combat
and could not refute the evidence. Before the hearing of the witnesses
was concluded Verres went into exile. He was condemned in
his absence and Cicero became the leading advocate of the day. However,
it must be admitted that the condemnation of Verres was also
partly due to the danger of the loss of their privileges which threatened
the senatorial jurors.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The crimes of Verres.</hi> The evidence which had been brought
out against Verres was afterwards used by Cicero in composing his
<hi rend="italic">Second Pleading against Verres</hi> (<hi rend="italic">actio secunda in Verrem</hi>) which was
of course never delivered, but was a political pamphlet in the form
of a fictitious oration. From it we learn the devices of which the
governor made use to amass a fortune at the expense of his province.
By initiating false accusations, by rendering, or intimidating other
judges to render unjust decisions, he secured the confiscation of property
the value of which he diverted to his own pockets. He sold justice
to the highest bidder. While saving himself expense by defrauding
the collectors of port dues of the tax on his valuables shipped out
of Sicily, he added to his profits by the sale of municipal offices and
priesthoods. He entered into partnership with the <hi rend="italic">decumani</hi> or collectors
of the ten per cent produce tax, and ordered the cultivators to
pay whatever the collectors demanded, and then, if dissatisfied, seek
redress in his court, a redress which, needless to say, was never gained.
He loaned public funds at usurious rates of interest, and either did
not pay in full or paid nothing for corn purchased from the Sicilian
communities for the Roman government, while charging the state the
market price. At the same time he insisted upon the cities commuting
into money payments at rates far above current prices the grain allotted
for the upkeep of the governor’s establishment. At times the
demands made upon cultivators exceeded the total of their annual
crop, and in despair they fled from their holdings. To the money
gained by such methods Verres added a costly treasure of works of
art, which he collected from both individuals and cities by theft,
seizure and intimidation. Even the sacred ornaments of temples were
not spared. All who resisted or denounced him, even Roman citizens,
<pb n="159"/><anchor id="Pg159"/>were subjected to illegal imprisonment, torture or execution. These
iniquities were carried out in defiance of the provincial charter, but
there was no power in his province to restrain him, and the Senate,
which should have done so, remained indifferent to the complaints
which were carried to Rome. The sad truth was that after all Verres
was only more shameless and unscrupulous than the average provincial
governor, and consequently the sympathies of the Senate were
with him rather than with his victims—the provincials.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">V. The Commands of Pompey against the Pirates and in
the East: 67–62 b. c.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The pirate scourge.</hi> Both Pompey and Crassus had declined proconsular
appointments at the close of 70 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, because there were no
provinces open which promised an opportunity to augment their influence
or military reputation. Accordingly they remained in Rome
watching for some more favorable chance to employ their talents.
Pompey found such an opportunity in the ravages of the Cilician
pirates. After the failure of Marcus Antonius (74–72 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>), Caecilius
Metellus had been sent to Crete in 69 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> and in the course
of the next two years reduced the island to subjection and made it a
province. But his operations there did little to check the pirate
plague. So bold had these robbers become that they did not hesitate
to raid the coasts of Italy and to plunder Ostia. When finally their
depredations interrupted the importation of grain for the supply of
the city, a famine threatened, and decisive measures had to be taken
against them.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Gabinian Law, 67 B. C.</hi> The only way to deal with the
question was to appoint a commander with power to operate against
the pirates everywhere, and the obvious man for the position was
Pompey. However, the Senate mistrusted him and in addition feared
the consequences of creating such an extensive extraordinary command.
But since 71 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Pompey had stood on the side of the
<hi rend="italic">populares</hi> and now, like Marius, he found in the tribunate an ally
able to aid him in attaining his goal. In 67 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the tribune Aulus
Gabinius proposed a law for the appointment of a single commander
of consular rank who should have command over the whole sea within
the pillars of Hercules and all Roman territory to a distance of fifty
miles inland. His appointment was to be for three years, he was
<pb n="160"/><anchor id="Pg160"/>to have the power to nominate senatorial <hi rend="italic">legati</hi>, to raise money in
addition to what he received from the quaestors, and recruit soldiers
and sailors at discretion for his fleet. This command was modelled
upon that of Antonius the praetor in 74 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, but conveyed higher
authority and greater resources. The Senate bitterly resisted the
passage of the bill but it passed and the Senate had to relinquish
its prerogative of creating the extraordinary commands. Although no
person had been nominated for this command in the law of Gabinius,
the opinion of the voters had been so clearly expressed in a <hi rend="italic">contio</hi> that
the Senate had to appoint Pompey. He received twenty-four <hi rend="italic">legati</hi>
and a fleet of five hundred vessels.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The pirates crushed.</hi> Pompey set to work energetically and systematically.
In forty days he swept the pirates from the western
Mediterranean. In forty-nine more he cornered them in Cilicia,
where he forced the surrender of their strongholds. His victory was
hastened by the mildness shown to those who surrendered. They
received their lives and freedom, and in many cases were used as colonists
to revive cities with a declining population. Within three
months he had brought the pirate war to a triumphant conclusion, but
his <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> would not terminate for three years and he was anxious
to gather fresh laurels.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Manilian Law, 66 B. C.</hi> It so happened that Pompey’s success
coincided with the temporary check to the Roman arms in Pontus,
owing to the disaffection of the troops of Lucullus and the machinations
of the latter’s enemies in Rome. Pompey now sought to have
the command of Lucullus added to his own, and in this he had the
support of the equestrian order. Early in 66 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> one of the tribunes,
Caius Manilius, proposed a law transferring to Pompey the
provinces of Bithynia and Cilicia and the conduct of the war against
Mithradates and Tigranes. Cicero, then a praetor, supported the
measure in his speech, <hi rend="italic">For the Manilian Law</hi>. His support was
probably dictated by the fact that he was a man without family backing
and consequently had to have the friendship of an influential
personage if he was to secure the political advancement which he desired.
The Senate strongly opposed any extension of Pompey’s military
authority, but the bill was passed and he took over the command
of Lucullus. He was clothed with power to make peace or war with
whom he chose, and enjoyed an unexampled concentration of authority
in his hands.
</p>

<pb n="161"/><anchor id="Pg161"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The campaigns of Pompey in the East.</hi> Pompey at once advanced
into Pontus and attacked Mithradates. The latter was forced
to withdraw into Lesser Armenia where he was overtaken and his
army scattered by Pompey. The king fled to the neighborhood of the
Sea of Asov. Upon the defeat of Mithradates, Tigranes deserted his
cause and submitted to Pompey. He was permitted to retain his
kingdom as a Roman ally. In the following year, 65 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Pompey
reduced to submission the peoples situated south of the Caucasus, between
the Black and the Caspian Seas, who had been in alliance with
Mithradates, and so completed the subjugation of Pontus, which he
made into a province (64 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
In 64 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he turned his attention to Syria, where a state of chaos
had reigned since Lucullus had wrested it from Tigranes and where
a scion of the Seleucids had failed to find recognition. Pompey decided
to treat Syria as a Roman conquest and incorporate it within
the empire. He then interfered in a dynastic struggle in the kingdom
of Judaea. After a brief struggle, in which the temple of Jerusalem
was stormed by the Romans, he installed his nominee as High
Priest at the head of the local government. Judaea was then annexed
to the province of Syria (63 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
While Pompey was in Judaea the death of Mithradates occurred.
Deserted by the Greek cities of the northern Euxine, he formed the
plan of joining the Celtic peoples of the Danube valley and invading
Italy. But his army deserted him for his son Pharnaces, who revolted
against his father, and Mithradates committed suicide. Thereupon
Pharnaces made peace with Pompey.
</p>

<p>
The Mithradatic war was finally over and Pompey, after organizing
affairs in Asia Minor and the adjoining countries, started on a triumphal
return to Italy with his victorious army and rich spoils of
war (62 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>).

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">VI. The Conspiracy of Catiline, 63 b. c.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The situation in Rome.</hi> While Pompey was adding to his military
reputation in the East he was regarded with jealous and anxious
eyes not only by the Senate but also by the other champions of the
popular party, Crassus who found his wealth no match for Pompey’s
military achievements, and Caius Julius Caesar who was rapidly
coming to be one of the leading figures in Roman public life. Caesar
<pb n="162"/><anchor id="Pg162"/>was born in 100 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, of the patrician <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> of the Julii, but since his
aunt was the wife of Marius, and he himself had married the daughter
of Cinna, his lot was cast with the Populares. As a young man
he had distinguished himself by refusing to divorce his wife at Sulla’s
behest, whereat Sulla was with difficulty induced to spare his life,
saying that he saw in him many a Marius. For the time being Caesar
judged it prudent to withdraw from Rome to Rhodes. While in the
East he was captured by pirates, and after being ransomed, fulfilled
his threat to avenge himself by taking and executing his captors.
After the death of Sulla, Caesar returned to Rome and devoted his
more than average oratorical abilities to the cause of the Marians.
In 69 or 68 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he was quaestor in Farther Spain, and shortly afterwards
he became closely associated with Crassus in the attempt to
develop a counterpoise to Pompey’s influence. While aedile in 65
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he curried favor with the populace by the extraordinary lavishness
with which he celebrated the public festivals, by the restoration
of the public monuments of the campaign of Marius and by supporting
the prosecution of agents in the Sullan proscriptions. The splendor
of his shows had obliged Caesar to contract heavy debts, and Crassus
was in all probability his chief creditor. Both were therefore interested
in securing for Caesar a position in which he could secure the
wealth to meet his obligations.
</p>

<p>
The unrest in Rome was heightened by the presence there of a
number of men of ruined fortunes, both Marians dispossessed by
Sulla and those of the opposite party who had squandered their resources
or had been excluded from the Senate by the censors of 70 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
This element was ready to resort to any means, however desperate, to
win wealth or office. Foremost among them was Lucius Sergius
Catilina, a patrician who enjoyed an evil repute for his share in the
Sullan proscriptions and the viciousness of his private life. Symptomatic
of the weakening of the public authority was the organization
of partizan gangs to terrorize opposition and control the Assembly.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Cicero elected consul, 64 B. C.</hi> In the year 64 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> three candidates
presented themselves for the consulship, Catiline, Caius Antonius,
a noble of the same type as Catiline, and Cicero. The first
two were supported by Caesar and Crassus who hoped to use them
for their own ends. Cicero, as a <hi rend="italic">novus homo</hi>, was distasteful to the
Optimates, but since they felt that Catiline must be defeated at all
costs they supported the orator, who was elected with Antonius.
<pb n="163"/><anchor id="Pg163"/>From that time Cicero ranged himself on the side of the <anchor id="corr163"/><corr sic="Optimates.">Optimates,</corr>
and his political watchword was the <q>harmony of the orders,</q> that
is, of the senators and the equestrians. Of the consular provinces
Cicero received by lot Macedonia and Antonius Cisalpine Gaul. As
the latter was dissatisfied Cicero resigned Macedonia to him, in return
for his public assurance of abstaining from opposing Cicero’s acts
during their year of office.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The land bill of Rullus, 63 B. C.</hi> On the first day of his consulate
Cicero delivered a speech in which he scathingly criticized a
land bill proposed by the tribune Servilius Rullus. This bill aimed
to create a land commission of ten members of praetorian rank, elected
in a special <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> of seventeen tribes, which Rullus was to choose
by lot. These commissioners were to be vested with extraordinary
powers for five years, including the right to sell the public land in
Italy and in Pompey’s recent conquests, to exercise judicial authority,
to confiscate lands, to found colonies, and to enroll and maintain
troops. The bill would have placed in the hands of the commissioners
extraordinary military authority both in Italy and in the provinces,
guaranteed by the income derived from the sale of land. Pompey
was excluded from the commission by a clause requiring the personal
appearance of candidates. Everyone was aware that the measure
was devised in the interests of Caesar and Crassus and that they
would dominate the commission. However, the attack upon the Senate’s
control of the public land and the general mistrust of the purposes
of a bill of this sort caused such strong opposition that its
sponsors did not bring the matter to a vote.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Caesar, <anchor id="corr163a"/><corr sic="Pontifix">Pontifex</corr> Maximus.</hi> But Caesar could console himself
with victory in another sphere. The position of <corr sic="Pontifix">Pontifex</corr> Maximus
had become vacant, and by a tribunician bill the <hi rend="italic">lex Domitia</hi>, revoked
by Sulla, was again brought into effect and election to the
priesthood entrusted to a <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> of seventeen tribes. In the ensuing
election Caesar was victorious.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Catilinarian conspiracy: 63 B. C.</hi> In July, 63 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, occurred
the consular elections for the next year. Catiline was again
a competitor, but now he lacked the support of Crassus and Caesar
and appealed directly to all needy and desperate characters throughout
Italy, who hoped to enrich themselves by violent means. He was
bitterly opposed by Cicero and the Optimates and was defeated.
Thereupon he and his followers conspired to overthrow the
govern<pb n="164"/><anchor id="Pg164"/>ment by armed force. Cicero, who was on the watch, got news of the
conspiracy and induced the Senate to pass the <q>last decree</q> empowering
him to use any means to save the state. Catiline then left
the city to join the bands his supporters had raised in Etruria. He
was declared a public enemy and a force under the consul Antonius
dispatched against him. December seventeenth was the day set for
a rising in Rome, when the city was to be fired, the consuls and others
murdered, and a reign of terror instituted. But the plan was betrayed
by a delegation of the Gallic Allobroges who happened to be
in Rome and whom the conspirators endeavored to enlist on their
side. The leading Catilinarians in Rome were arrested, and, in accordance
with a decree of the Senate, put to death. Caesar had
argued for a milder sentence, but the firm stand of the young Marcus
Porcius Cato, a man of uncompromising uprightness and loyalty to
the constitution, sealed the fate of the plotters. Upon the failure of
his plans in Rome, Catiline endeavored to make his way with his
army into Cisalpine Gaul, but was overtaken and forced to give battle
to the forces of Antonius at Pistoria. He and most of his followers
died sword in hand. The suppression of the conspiracy added to
Cicero’s reputation and greatly strengthened the position of the Senate
and the Optimates.
</p>

<p>
But the whole episode bears testimony to the general weakness of
the government and the danger of the absence of a regular police
force for the maintenance of the public peace.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Pompey’s return.</hi> Towards the close of the year 62 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Pompey
landed in Italy and, contrary to the expectations of those who feared
that he would prove a second Sulla, disbanded his army. The following
September (61) he celebrated a memorable triumph. He was
exceedingly anxious to crown his achievements by having the Senate
ratify his eastern arrangements and securing land grants for his
veterans. However, since the dismissal of his troops he was no
longer feared by the Senate, which insisted on examining his acts in
detail and not ratifying them <hi rend="italic">en bloc</hi> as he demanded. Thus the
Optimates lost the opportunity of binding Pompey to their side, and
at the same time they fell out with the equestrians over the demand
<pb n="165"/><anchor id="Pg165"/>made by the <hi rend="italic">publicani</hi> who had contracted for the taxes of Asia for a
modification of the terms of their contract on the ground of poor harvests
in the province.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The coalition of 60 B. C.</hi> No settlement had been reached when
Caesar returned to Rome in 60 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> He had been praetor in 62 and
for the following year governor of Further Spain, where he waged successful
border wars, conciliated the provincials and yet contrived to
find the means to satisfy his creditors. He now requested a triumph
and the privilege of standing for the consulate while waiting outside
the city for the former honor. However, when the Senate delayed its
decision he gave up the triumph and became a candidate for the
consulate. He now succeeded in reconciling Pompey and Crassus and
the three formed a secret coalition to secure the election of Caesar
and the satisfaction of their particular aims. This unofficial coalition
is known as the First Triumvirate. Through the influence of his
supporters Caesar was easily elected but his colleague was Calpurnius
Bibulus, the nominee of the Optimates.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">A rule of force.</hi> At the beginning of his consulship Caesar tried
to induce the Senate to approve his measures, but, when they failed
to do so, he carried them directly to the Assembly. And when Bibulus
and Cato essayed to obstruct legislation in the Comitia he crushed
all opposition by the aid of Pompey’s veterans. Bibulus, protesting
against the illegality of Caesar’s proceedings, shut himself up in his
own house. Thus Caesar carried two land laws for the benefit of the
soldiers of Pompey, induced the Senate to ratify the latter’s eastern
settlement, and secured for the equestrians, whose cause was championed
by Crassus, the remission of one third of the contract price
for the revenues of Asia.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Vatinian Law.</hi> A lucky chance enabled Caesar to secure
his own future by an extended military command. The Senate had
taken pains to render him harmless by assigning as the consular
provinces for 58 the care of forests and country roads in Italy, but in
February, 59, the death of Metellus Celer, proconsul of Cisalpine
Gaul, left vacant a post of considerable importance in view of the
imminent danger of war breaking out in Transalpine Gaul. Accordingly
a law proposed by the tribune Vatinius transferred to Caesar
the command of Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum, with a garrison of
three legions, for a term of five years beginning 1 March, 59. To
this the Senate, at the suggestion of Pompey, added Transalpine Gaul
and another legion.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The banishment of Cicero, 58 B. C.</hi> Caesar’s consulship had
been an open defiance of constitutional precedent, and had revealed
the fact that the triumvirate was stronger than the established organs
of government, and that the Roman Empire was really controlled by
<pb n="167"/><anchor id="Pg167"/>three men. Well might Cato say that the coalition was the beginning
of the end of the Republic. Within the triumvirate itself Pompey
was the dominant figure owing to his military renown and the influence
of his veterans. Caesar appeared as his agent, yet displayed far
greater political insight and succeeded in creating for himself a position
which would enable him to play a more independent rôle in the
future. The coalition did not break up at the end of Caesar’s consulship;
its members determined to retain their control of the state
policy, and to this end secured for 58 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the election of two consuls
in whom they had confidence. To cement the alliance Pompey married
Caesar’s daughter Julia, and Caesar married the daughter of
Piso, one of the consuls-elect. To secure themselves from attack they
felt it necessary to remove from the city their two ablest opponents,
Cato and Cicero. The latter had refused all proposals to join their
side, and had sharply criticized them on several public occasions.
His banishment was secured through the agency of the tribune Clodius,
whose transfer from patrician to plebeian status Caesar had
facilitated. Clodius was a man of ill repute who hated Cicero because
the latter had testified against him when he was on trial for
sacrilege. Early in 58 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Clodius carried a bill which outlawed
any person who had put to death Roman citizens without regular
judicial proceedings. This law was aimed at Cicero for his share
in the execution of the Catalinarian conspirators. Finding that he
could not rely upon the support of his friends, Cicero went into exile
without awaiting trial. He was formally banished, his property was
confiscated, and he himself sought refuge in Thessalonica, where the
governor of Macedonia offered him protection. Cato was entrusted
with a special mission to accomplish the incorporation of Cyprus, then
ruled by one of the Egyptian Ptolemies, into the Roman Empire, and
his Stoic conception of duty prevented him from refusing the appointment.
Caesar remained with his army in the vicinity of Rome
until after Cicero’s banishment and then set out for his province.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The defeat of the Helvetii and Ariovistus: 58 B. C.</hi> In 58 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>,
when Caesar entered upon his Gallic command, the Roman province
in Transalpine Gaul (<hi rend="italic">Gallia <anchor id="corr167"/><corr sic="Narbonesis">Narbonensis</corr></hi>) embraced the coast districts
from the Alps to the borders of Spain and the land between the
<pb n="168"/><anchor id="Pg168"/>Alps and the Rhone as far north as Lake Geneva. The country
which stretched from the Pyrenees to the Rhine, and from the Rhone
to the ocean was called <hi rend="italic">Gallia comata</hi> or <q>long-haired Gaul,</q> and
was occupied by a large number of peoples of varying importance.
These were usually regarded as falling into three groups, (1) those
of Aquitania, between the Pyrenees and the Loire, where there was a
large Iberian element, (2) those called Celts, in a narrow sense of
the word, stretching from the Loire to the Seine and the Marne, and
(3) the Belgian Gauls, dwelling between these rivers and the Rhine.
Among the latter were peoples of Germanic origin. Although conscious
of a general unity of language, race and customs, the Gauls
had not developed a national state, owing to the mutual jealousy of
the individual peoples, and each tribe was perpetually divided into
rival factions supporting different chiefs. Rome had sought to protect
the province of Narbonensis by establishing friendly relations
with some of these Gallic peoples and had long before (c. 121 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>)
made an alliance with the Aedui. About 70 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> conditions in <hi rend="italic">Gallia
comata</hi> had been disturbed by an invasion of Germanic Suevi, from
across the Rhine, under their King Ariovistus. He united with the
rivals of the Aedui, the Sequani, and after a number of years reduced
the former to submission. In 59 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he reached an agreement with
Rome, became a <q>friend</q> of the Roman people, and, while abstaining
from further aggression, remained firmly established in what is
now Alsace. For some time the Roman province had been alarmed
by the threat of a migration of the Helvetii, then settled in western
Switzerland, and in March, 58 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, this people started in search of
new abodes. Caesar reached Gaul in time to prevent their crossing
the upper Rhone, and followed them as they turned westward into the
lands of the Sequani and Aedui. Defeated in two battles, they were
forced to return to their home and to become allies of Rome. The
movement of the Helvetii had given Caesar the opportunity for intervention
in <hi rend="italic">Gallia comata</hi>, and a pretext for extending his influence
there was found in the hostility of some of the Gauls to Ariovistus,
and the knowledge that a band of Suevi was expected soon to cross
the Rhine to reinforce the latter. To frustrate a German occupation
of Gaul now became Caesar’s object. Ariovistus rejected the demands
of Caesar, who thereupon attacked him, defeated him in the
vicinity of Strassburg and drove him across the Rhine. Caesar was
now the dominant power in Gaul, and many of the leading tribes
en<pb n="169"/><anchor id="Pg169"/>tered into alliance with Rome. Of the Belgae, however, only the
Remi came over to the side of Rome.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The conquest of the Belgae, Veneti, and Aquitanians, 57–56
B. C.</hi> In the next year, 57 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Caesar marched against the united
forces of the Belgae, defeated them, and subdued many tribes, chief
of whom were the Nervii. At the same time his legates received the
submission of the peoples of Normandy and Brittany. In the course
of the following winter some of these, led by the Veneti, broke off their
alliance and attacked Caesar’s garrisons. Thereupon he set to work
to build a fleet, with which in the course of the next summer the
fleet of the Veneti was destroyed and their strongholds on the coast
taken (56 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). The same year witnessed the submission of the
Aquitanians, which brought practically the whole of Gaul under
Roman sway.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Events in Rome, 58–55 B. C.</hi> Meanwhile important changes had
taken place in the situation at Rome. Pompey had broken with Clodius,
and supported the tribune Titus Annius Milo who pressed for
Cicero’s recall. A law of the Assembly withdrew his sentence of
outlawry, his property was restored, and the orator returned in September,
57 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, to enjoy a warm reception both in the municipal
towns and at the capital. For the moment Pompey and the Optimates
were on friendly terms, and the former made use of a grain
famine in the city to secure for himself an appointment as curator of
the grain supply (<hi rend="italic">curator annonae</hi>) for a period of five years. This
appointment carried with it <anchor id="corr169"/><corr sic="preconsular">proconsular</corr> <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> within and without
Italy, and the control of the ports, markets and traffic in grain
within the Roman dominions. It was really an extraordinary military
command. Pompey relieved the situation but could do nothing
to allay the disorders in Rome, where Clodius and Milo with their
armed gangs set law and order at defiance. The news of Caesar’s
victories and the influence which he was acquiring in the city by a
judicious distribution of the spoils of war fired the ambitions of
Pompey and Crassus who were no longer on good terms with one
another. Furthermore, the return of Cato in 56 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> had again given
the Optimates an energetic leader. Consequently Caesar felt it necessary
for the coalition to reach a new agreement. Accordingly while
spending the winter in Cisalpine Gaul he arranged a conference at
Luca in April, 56, where the three settled their differences and laid
plans for the future. They agreed that Pompey and Crassus should
<pb n="170"/><anchor id="Pg170"/>be consuls in 55 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, that the former should be given the Spanish
provinces and Libya for five years, that Crassus should have Syria
for an equal period, and that Caesar’s command in Gaul should be
prolonged for another five year term to run from 1 March, 54.<note place="foot">On the much disputed date of the end of Caesar’s second term, see Hardy, E. G.,
<hi rend="italic">Journal of Philology</hi>, 1918, pp. 161 ff.</note>
</p>

<p>
These arrangements were duly carried out. Since it was too late
for Pompey and Crassus to be candidates at the regular elections in
56 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, they forcibly prevented any elections being held that year.
The following January, after forcing the other candidates to withdraw,
they secured their election. Thereupon a law of the tribune
Gaius Trebonius made effective the assignment of provinces agreed
upon at Luca. Once more it was made plain that the coalition
actually ruled the empire. Cicero, who was indebted to Pompey for
his recall, was forced to support the triumvirate, and the Optimates
found their boldest leader in Cato, who had returned to Rome early
in 56 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Caesar’s crossing of the Rhine and invasion of Britain: 55–54
B. C.</hi> During the winter following the subjugation of the Veneti,
two Germanic tribes, the Usipetes and the Tencteri, crossed the lower
Rhine into Gaul. In the next summer, 55 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Caesar attacked and
annihilated their forces, only a few escaping across the river. As a
warning against future invasion, Caesar bridged the Rhine and made
a demonstration upon the right bank, destroying his bridge when he
withdrew. Towards the close of the summer he crossed the Straits of
Dover to Britain, to punish the Britons for aiding his enemies in
Gaul. But owing to the lateness of the season and the smallness of
his force he returned to Gaul after a brief reconnaissance.
</p>

<p>
In the following year, after gathering a larger fleet, he again landed
on the island with a force of almost 30,000 men. This time he forced
his way across the Thames and received the submission of Cassivellaunus,
the chief who led the British tribes against the invaders.
After taking hostages, and receiving promises of tribute, Caesar returned
to Gaul. Britain was in no sense subdued, but the island had
felt the power of Rome, and, besides enlarging the geographical knowledge
of the time, Caesar had brought back numbers of captives. In
Rome the exploit produced great excitement and enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Revolts in Gaul: 54–53 B. C.</hi> Although the Gauls had submitted
to Caesar, they were not yet reconciled to Roman rule, which put an
<pb n="171"/><anchor id="Pg171"/>end to their inter-tribal wars and to the feuds among the nobility.
Consequently, many of the tribes were restive and not inclined to surrender
all hopes of freedom without another struggle. In the course
of the winter 54–53 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the Nervii, Treveri and Eburones in Belgian
Gaul attacked the Roman detachments stationed in their territories.
One of these was cut to pieces but the rest held their ground until
relieved by Caesar, who stamped out the rebellion.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Vercingetorix, 52 B. C.</hi> A more serious movement started in
52 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> among the peoples of central Gaul who found a national
leader in Vercingetorix, a young noble of the Arverni. The revolt
took Caesar by surprise when he was in Cisalpine Gaul and his
troops still scattered in winter quarters. He recrossed the Alps with
all haste, secured the Narbonese province and succeeded in uniting
his forces. These he strengthened with German cavalry from across
the Rhine. However, a temporary check in an attack upon the position
of Vercingetorix at Gergovia caused the Aedui to desert the Roman
cause, and the revolt spread to practically the whole of Gaul.
Caesar was on the point of retiring to the province, but after repulsing
an attack made upon him he was able to pen up Vercingetorix
in the fortress of Alesia. A great effort made by the Gauls to relieve
the siege failed to break Caesar’s lines, and the defenders were
starved into submission. The crisis was over, although another year
was required before the revolting tribes were all reduced to submission
and the Roman authority re-established (51 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). Caesar used
all possible mildness in his treatment of the conquered and the Gauls
were not only pacified but won over. In the days to come they were
among his most loyal supporters. The conquest of Gaul was an
event of supreme importance for the future history of the Roman
empire, and for the development of European civilization as well.
For the time <hi rend="italic">Gallia comata</hi> was not formed into a province. Its peoples
were made allies of Rome, under the supervision of the governor
of Narbonese Gaul, under obligation to furnish troops and for the
most part liable to a fixed tribute. Caesar’s campaign in Gaul had
given him the opportunity to develop his unusual military talents
and to create a veteran army devoted to himself. His power had
become so great that both Pompey and the Optimates desired his destruction
and he was in a position to refuse to be eliminated without
a struggle. The plots laid in Rome to deprive him of his power had
made him hasten to quell the revolt of the Gauls with all speed.
<pb n="172"/><anchor id="Pg172"/>When this was accomplished he was free to turn his attention to
Roman affairs.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Crassus in Syria, 55–53 B. C.</hi> After the assignment of the
provinces by the Trebonian Law in 55 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Crassus set out for Syria
intending to win military power and prestige by a war against the
Parthians, an Asiatic people who, once the subjects of the Persians
and Seleucids, had established a kingdom which included the provinces
of the Seleucid empire as far west as the Euphrates. Crassus
had no real excuse for opening hostilities, but the Parthians were a
potentially dangerous neighbor and a campaign against them gave
promise of profit and glory. Accordingly, in 54 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Crassus made
a short incursion into Mesopotamia and then withdrew to Syria. The
next year he again crossed the Euphrates, intending to penetrate
deeply into the enemy’s country. But he had underestimated the
strength of the Parthians and the difficulties of desert warfare. In
the Mesopotamian desert near Carrhae his troops were surrounded
and cut to pieces by the Parthian horsemen; Crassus himself was
enticed into a conference and treacherously slain, and only a small
remnant of his force escaped (53 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). But the Parthians were
slow in following up their advantage and Crassus’ quaestor, Cassius
Longinus, was able to hold Syria. Still Roman prestige in the East
had received a severe blow and for the next three centuries the Romans
found the Parthians dangerous neighbors. The death of
Crassus tended to hasten a crisis in Rome for it brought into sharp
conflict the incompatible ambitions of Pompey and Caesar, whose
estrangement had already begun with the death of Pompey’s wife
Julia in 54 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Affairs in Rome, 54–49 B. C.</hi> At the end of his consulship Pompey
left Rome but remained in Italy, on the pretext of his curatorship
of the grain supply, and governed his province through his legates.
In Rome disorder reigned; no consuls were elected in 54 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> nor
before July of the following year; the partizans of Clodius and Milo
kept everything in confusion. Pompey could have restored order
but preferred to create a situation which would force the Senate to
grant him new powers, so he backed Clodius, while Milo championed
the Optimates. Owing to broils between the supporters of the candidates,
no consuls or praetors could be elected for 52 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> In January
of that year Clodius was slain by Milo’s body-guard on the
Appian Way, and the ensuing outburst of mob violence in the city
<pb n="173"/><anchor id="Pg173"/>forced the Senate to appeal to Pompey. He was made sole consul,
until he should choose a colleague, and was entrusted with the task of
restoring order. His troops brought quiet into the city; Milo was
tried on a charge of public violence, convicted, and banished. Pompey
had attained the height of his official career; he was sole consul,
at the same time he had a province embracing the Spains, Libya,
and the sphere assigned to him with the grain curatorship, he governed
his provinces through <hi rend="italic">legati</hi>, and his armies were maintained
by the public treasury. In reality he was the chief power in the
state, for without him the Senate was helpless, and he was justly
regarded by contemporaries as the First Citizen or Princeps. In
many ways his position foreshadowed the Principate of Augustus.
However, Pompey did not wish to overthrow the republican régime;
his ambition was to be regarded as the indispensable and permanent
mainstay of the government and to enjoy corresponding power and
honor. In such a scheme there was no room for a rival, and therefore
he determined upon Caesar’s overthrow. This decision put him
on the side of the extreme Optimates, who were alarmed by Caesar’s
wealth, influence and fame and feared him as a dangerous radical.
They had no hesitation in choosing between Pompey and Caesar.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Pompey’s attack upon Caesar: 52 B. C.</hi> The latter’s immediate
aim was to secure the consulship for 48 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> and to retain his proconsular
command until the end of December, 49. He knew that he
had reached a position where his destruction was the desire of many,
and that the moment he surrendered his <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> he would be open
to prosecution by those seeking to procure his ruin. But he had no
intention of placing himself in the power of his enemies. The consulship
would not only save him from prosecution but would enable him
to confirm his arrangements in Gaul, reward his army, and secure
his own future by another proconsular appointment. However, to
secure his election, he had to be exempted from presenting himself
in person for his candidature in 49, and this permission was accorded
him by a tribunician law early in 52 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> So far his position was
strictly legal, but Pompey, whose own consulship was unconstitutional,
now broke openly with Caesar by passing legislation which
would undermine the latter’s position. One of Pompey’s laws prohibited
candidacies for office <hi rend="italic">in absentia</hi>, and when Caesar’s friends
protested, he added to the text of the law after it had passed a clause
exempting Caesar from its operation; a procedure of more than dubious
<pb n="174"/><anchor id="Pg174"/>legality. A second law provided that in future provincial governorships
should not be filled by the city magistrates just completing their
term of office but by those whose terms had expired five years previously.
This latter law may have been intended to check the mad
rivalry for provincial appointments, but its immediate significance
lay in the fact that it permitted a successor to be appointed to take
over Caesar’s provinces on 1 March, 49 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> He would thus have
to stand as a private citizen for the consulship and would no longer
enjoy immunity from legal attack. At the same time Pompey had his
own command in Spain extended for another five years.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Negotiations between Caesar, Pompey and the Senate, 51–50
B. C.</hi> The question of appointing a successor to Caesar’s provinces
filled the next two years and was the immediate cause of civil war.
Caesar claimed that his position should not be affected by the Pompeian
law, and pressed for permission to hold his command until the
close of 49 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> The extreme conservatives sought to supersede him
on March first of that year, but Caesar’s friends and agents thwarted
their efforts. Pompey was not willing to have Caesar’s command to
run beyond 13 November, 49. Cicero, who had distinguished himself
by his uprightness as governor of Cilicia in 51, strove to effect
a compromise, but in vain. Caesar offered to give up Transalpine
Gaul and part of his army, if allowed to retain the Cisalpine province
but the overture was rejected. Finally, in December, 50 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, he
formally promised to resign his provinces and disband his troops, if
Pompey would do the same, but the Senate insisted upon his absolute
surrender. On 7 January, 49 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, the Senate passed the <q>last decree</q>
calling upon the magistrates and proconsuls (i. e. Pompey)
to protect the state, and declaring Caesar a public enemy. Caesar’s
friends left the city and fled to meet him in Cisalpine Gaul, where he
and his army were in readiness for this emergency.

49–46 b. c.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Caesar’s conquest of Italy and Spain, 49 B. C.</hi> The senatorial
conservatives had forced the issue and for Caesar there remained the
alternative of victory or destruction. He possessed the advantages of
a loyal army ready for immediate action and the undisputed control
<pb n="175"/><anchor id="Pg175"/>over his own troops. On the other hand, his opponents had no veteran
troops in Italy, and although Pompey acted as commander-in-chief of
the senatorial forces, he was greatly hampered by having at times to
defer to the judgment of the consuls and senators who were in his
camp. It was obviously to Caesar’s advantage to take the offensive
and to force a decision before his enemies could concentrate against
him the resources of the provinces. Hence he determined to act without
delay, and, upon receiving news of the Senate’s action on 7 January,
he crossed the Rubicon, which divided Cisalpine Gaul and Italy,
with a small force, ordering the legions beyond the Alps to join him
with all speed. The Italian municipalities opened their gates at his
approach and the newly raised levies went over to his side. Everywhere
his mildness to his opponents won him new adherents. Pompey
decided to abandon Italy and withdraw to the East, intending
later to concentrate upon the peninsula from all sides; a plan made
feasible by his control of the sea. Caesar divined his intention and
tried to cut off his retreat at Brundisium, but could not prevent his
embarkation. With his army and the majority of the Senate Pompey
crossed to Epirus. Owing to his lack of a fleet Caesar could not follow
and returned to Rome. There some of the magistrates were still
functioning, in conjunction with a remnant of the Senate. Being in
dire need of money, he wished to obtain funds from the treasury, and
when this was opposed by a tribune, Caesar ignored the latter’s
veto and forcibly seized the reserve treasure which the Pompeians
had left behind in their hasty flight. In the meantime Caesar’s lieutenants
had seized Sardinia and Sicily, and crossed over into Africa.
He himself determined to attack the well organized Pompeian forces
in Spain and destroy them before Pompey was ready for an offensive
from the East. On his way to Spain, Caesar began the siege of
Massalia which closed its gates to him. Leaving the city under
blockade he hastened to Spain, where after an initial defeat he forced
the surrender of the Pompeian armies. Some of the prisoners joined
his forces; the rest were dismissed to their homes. Caesar hastened
back to Massalia. The city capitulated at his arrival, and was punished
by requisitions, the loss of its territory and the temporary deprivation
of its autonomy. From here Caesar pressed on to Rome, where
he had been appointed dictator by virtue of a special law. After
holding the elections in which he and an approved colleague were
returned as consuls for 48, he resigned his dictatorship and set out
<pb n="176"/><anchor id="Pg176"/>for Brundisium. There he had assembled his army and transports
for the passage to Epirus.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Pharsalus, 48 B. C.</hi> During Caesar’s Spanish campaign Pompey
had gathered a large force in Macedonia, nine Roman legions reinforced
by contingents from the Roman allies. His fleet, recruited
largely from the maritime cities in the East, commanded the Adriatic.
Nevertheless, at the opening of winter (Nov. 49 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>) Caesar effected
a landing on the coast of Epirus with part of his army and seized
Apollonia. However, Pompey arrived from Macedonia in time to
save Dyrrhachium. Throughout the winter the two armies remained
inactive, but Pompey’s fleet prevented Caesar from receiving reinforcements
until the spring of 48 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, when Marcus Antonius effected
a crossing with another detachment. As Caesar’s troops began to
suffer from shortage of supplies he was forced to take the offensive
and tried to blockade Pompey’s larger force in Dyrrhachium. However,
the attempt failed, his lines of investment were broken, and he
withdrew to Thessaly. Thither he was followed by Pompey, who
suffered himself to be influenced by the overconfident senators to risk
a battle. Near the town of Old Pharsalus he attacked Caesar but
was defeated and his army dispersed. He himself sought refuge in
Egypt and there he was put to death by order of the king whose
father he had protected in the days of his power. Pompey’s great
weakness was that his resolution did not match his ambition. His
ambition led him to seek a position incompatible with the constitution;
but his lack of resolution did not permit him to overthrow the
constitution. The Optimates had sided with him only because they
held him less dangerous than Caesar and had he been victorious they
would have sought to compass his downfall.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Caesar in the East, 48–47 B. C.</hi> After Pharsalus Caesar had set
out in pursuit of Pompey, but arrived in Egypt after the murder of
his foe. His ever pressing need of money probably induced Caesar
to intervene as arbiter in the name of Rome in the dynastic struggle
then raging in Egypt between the twenty-year-old Cleopatra and her
thirteen-year-old brother, Ptolemy XIV Dionysus, who was also, following
the Egyptian custom, her husband. Caesar got the young
king in his power and brought back Cleopatra, whom the people of
Alexandria had driven out. Angered thereat, and resenting his exactions,
the Alexandrians rose in arms and from October, 48, to March,
47 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, <anchor id="corr176"/><corr sic="beseiged">besieged</corr> Caesar in the royal quarter of the city. Having
<pb n="177"/><anchor id="Pg177"/>but few troops with him Caesar was in dire straits and was only able
to maintain himself through his control of the sea which enabled him
to eventually receive reinforcements. His relief was effected by a
force raised by Mithradates of Pergamon who invaded Egypt from
Syria. In co-operation with him Caesar defeated the Egyptians in
battle; Ptolemy Dionysus perished in flight; and Alexandria submitted.
Cleopatra was married to a still younger brother and put in
possession of the kingdom of Egypt. Caesar had succumbed to the
charms of the Egyptian queen and tarried in her company for the rest
of the winter. He was called away to face a new danger in Pharnaces,
son of Mithradates Eupator, who had taken advantage of the civil war
to recover Pontus and overrun Lesser Armenia, Cappadocia and Bithynia.
Hastening through Syria Caesar entered Pontus and defeated
<anchor id="corr177"/><corr sic="Pharanaces">Pharnaces</corr> at Zela. After settling affairs in Asia Minor he proceeded
with all speed to the West, where his presence was urgently needed.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Thapsus, 46 B. C.</hi> Both the fleet and the army of Pompey had
dispersed after Pharsalus, but Caesar’s delay in the East had given
the republicans an opportunity to reassemble their forces. They
gathered in Africa where Caesar’s lieutenant Curio, who had invaded
the province in 49 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, had been defeated and killed by the Pompeians
through the aid of King Juba of Numidia. From Africa they
were now preparing to attack Italy. In Rome, Caesar had been appointed
dictator for 47 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> with Antony as his master of the horse.
Here disorder reigned as a result of the distress arising from the
financial stringency brought on by the war. Antony, who was in
Rome, had proved unable to deal with the situation. Caesar reached
Italy in September, 47 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, and soon restored order in the city. He
was then called upon to face a serious mutiny of his troops who demanded
the fulfillment of his promises of money and land and their
release from service. By boldness and presence of mind Caesar won
them back to their allegiance and set out for Africa in December,
47 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> He landed with only a portion of his troops and at first
was defeated by the republicans under Scipio and Juba. But he was
supported by King Bogud of Mauretania and a Catalinarian soldier
of fortune, Publius Sittius, and after receiving reinforcements
from Italy he besieged the seaport Thapsus. Scipio came to the
rescue but was completely defeated in a bloody battle near the town.
The whole of the province fell into Caesar’s hands. Cato, who was
in command of Utica, did not force the citizens to resist but
com<pb n="178"/><anchor id="Pg178"/>mitted suicide; the other republican leaders, including Juba, either
followed his example, or were taken and executed by the Caesarians.
From Africa Caesar returned to Rome where he celebrated a costly
triumph over Gaul, Egypt, Pharnaces and Juba. He was now undisputed
master of the state and proceeded according to his own judgment
to settle the problem of governing the Roman world.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The problem of imperial government.</hi> From 28 July, 46, to
15 March, 44 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Caesar ruled the Roman Empire with despotic
power, his position unchallenged except for a revolt of the Pompeian
party in Spain which required his attention from the autumn of 46
to the spring of 45 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> His victory over Pompey and the republicans
had placed upon him the obligation to provide the empire with
a stable form of government and this responsibility he accepted.
Sulla, when faced with the same problem, had been content to place
the Senate once more at the head of the state, but from his own experience
Caesar knew how futile this policy had been. Nor could the
ideal of Pompey commend itself as a means of ending civil war and
rebellion. Caesar was prepared to deal much more radically with the
old régime, but death overtook him before he had completed his reorganization.
What was the goal of his policy will best be understood
from a consideration of his official position during the year and
a half which followed the battle of Thapsus.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Caesar’s offices, powers and honors.</hi> Caesar’s autocratic position
rested in the last instance upon the support of his veterans, of the
associates who owed their advancement to him, and of such small
forces as he kept under arms, but his position was legalized by the
accumulation in his hands of various offices, special powers and unusual
honors. Foremost among his offices came the dictatorship.
We have seen that he had held this already for a short time in 49
and again in 47. In 46 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he was appointed dictator for ten
years, and in the following year for life. At the same time he was
consul, an office which he held continuously from 48 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, in 45 as
sole consul, but usually with a colleague. In addition to these offices
he enjoyed the tribunician authority (<hi rend="italic">tribunicia potestas</hi>), that is,
the power of the tribunes without the name. This included the right
to sit with the tribunes and the right of intercession, granted him as
<pb n="179"/><anchor id="Pg179"/>early as 48 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, and also personal inviolability (<hi rend="italic">sacrosanctitas</hi>)
which he received in 45. He had been Chief Pontiff since 63, and in
48 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> was admitted to all the patrician priestly corporations. And
in 46 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he was given the powers of the censorship under the title
of <q>prefect of morals</q> (<hi rend="italic">praefectus morum</hi>), at first for three years
and later for life. In addition to these official positions of more or
less established scope, Caesar received other powers not dependent
upon any office. He was granted the right to appoint to both Roman
and provincial magistracies, until in 44 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he had the authority to
nominate half the officials annually; and in reality appointed all. In
48 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he received the power of making war and peace without consulting
the Senate, in 46 the right of expressing his opinion first in
the Senate (<hi rend="italic">ius primae sententiae</hi>), and in 45 the sole right to command
troops and to control the public moneys. In the next year
ratification was given in advance to all his future arrangements, and
magistrates entering upon office were required to swear to uphold his
acts. The concentration of these powers in his person placed Caesar
above the law, and reduced the holders of public offices to the position
of his servants. Honors to match his extraordinary powers were
heaped upon Caesar, partly by his own desire, partly by the servility
and fulsome flattery of the Senate. He was granted a seat with the
consuls in the Senate, if he should not be consul himself; he received
the title of parent or father of his country (<hi rend="italic">parens</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pater patriae</hi>);
his statue was placed among those of the kings of Rome, his image in
the temple of Quirinus; the month Quinctilis, in which he was born,
was renamed Julius (July) in his honor; a new college of priests, the
Julian Luperci, was created; a temple was erected to himself and
the Goddess Clementia, and a priest (flamen) appointed for his worship
there; and he was authorized to build a house on the Palatine
with a pediment like a temple. Most of these honors he received
after his victory over the Pompeians in Spain in 45 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> However,
the title <hi rend="italic">imperator</hi> (Emperor), which was regularly the prerogative
of a general who was entitled to a triumph and was surrendered along
with his military <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>, was employed by Caesar continuously
from 49 until after the battle of Thapsus in 46, when he celebrated
his triumph over the Gauls and his other non-Roman enemies. He
assumed it again after Munda in the following year.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Caesar’s aim—monarchy.</hi> Taking into account the powers
which Caesar wielded and his lifelong tenure of certain offices there
<pb n="180"/><anchor id="Pg180"/>can be no doubt that he not only had established monarchical government
in Rome but also aimed to make his monarchy permanent.
And this gives the explanation why he accepted honors which were
more suited to a god than to a man, for since the time of Alexander
the Great deification had been accepted in the Greek East as the legal
and moral basis for the exercise of absolute power, and as distinguishing
a legitimate autocracy from a tyranny. To a polytheistic
age, familiar with the idea of the deification of <q>heroes</q> after death
and permeated in its educated circles with the teaching of Euhemerus
that the gods were but men who in their sojourn upon earth had been
benefactors of the human race, the deification of a monarch in no
way offended religious susceptibilities. The Romans were acquainted
with monarchies of this type in Syria and in Egypt. Indeed this was
the only type of monarchy familiar to the Romans of the first century
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, if we exclude the Parthian and other despotisms, and it
was bound to influence any form of monarchical government set up in
Rome. The plebs actually hailed Caesar as <q><hi rend="italic">rex</hi>,</q> and at the feast
of the Lupercalia in February, 44 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Antony publicly offered him
a crown. It is possible that he would have assumed the title if popular
opinion had supported this step. And there may well have been
some truth in the rumor that he contemplated marriage with Cleopatra,
who came to Rome in 46 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, for a queen would be a fit mate
for a monarch and such a step would have effected the peaceful incorporation
of Egypt into the Roman Empire.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Caesar’s reforms.</hi> Upon returning to Rome after the battle of
Thapsus Caesar began a series of reforms which affected practically
every side of Roman life. One of the most useful was the reform
of the Roman calendar. Hitherto the Romans had employed a lunar
year of three hundred and fifty-five days (the calendar year beginning
on March first and the civil year, since 153 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, on January first)
which was approximately corrected to the solar year by the addition
of an intercalary month of twenty-two days in the second, and one of
twenty-three days in the fourth year, of cycles of four years. For
personal or political motives the pontiffs had trifled with the intercalation
of these months until in 46 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the Roman year was completely
out of touch with the solar year. With the assistance of the Greek
astronomer Sosigenes, Caesar introduced the Egyptian solar year of
approximately 365¼ days, in such a way that three years of 365
days were followed by one of 366 days in which an extra day was
<pb n="181"/><anchor id="Pg181"/>added to February after the twenty-fourth of the month. The new
Julian calendar went into effect on 1 January, 45 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Another
abuse was partially rectified by the reduction of the number who were
entitled to receive cheap grain in Rome from about 320,000 to
150,000. The Roman plebeian colleges and guilds, which had become
political clubs and had contributed to the recent disorders in the city,
were dissolved with the exception of the ancient association of craftsmen.
The <hi rend="italic">tribuni aerarii</hi> were removed from the jury courts and the
penalties for criminal offences increased. Plans were laid for a
codification of the Roman law but this was not carried into effect.
Municipal administration in Rome and the Italian towns was regulated
by the Julian Municipal Law, which brought uniformity into
the municipal organization of Italy. The Roman magistracies were
increased in number; the quaestorships from twenty to forty, and
the eight praetorships finally to sixteen. At the same time the priesthoods
were likewise enlarged. Administrative needs and the wish to
reward a greater number of followers probably influenced these
changes. A number of new patrician families were created to take
the places of those which had died out. The membership of the
Senate was increased to 900, and many new men, including ex-soldiers
of Caesar and enfranchised Gauls, were enrolled in it. Caesar provided
for his veterans by settling them in Italian municipalities and
in colonies in the provinces. The deserted sites of Carthage and
Corinth were repeopled with Roman colonists and once more became
flourishing cities. In this way Caesar promoted the romanization
of the provinces, a policy which he had begun with his conferment of
the franchise upon the Transpadane Gauls in 49, and continued in
the case of many Spanish communities. This romanization of the
provinces and the admission of provincials to the Senate points to an
imperial policy which would end the exploitation of the provinces
in the interests of a governing caste and a city mob.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Munda, 45 B. C.</hi> Caesar proved himself a magnanimous conqueror.
No Sullan proscriptions disgraced his victory. After Pharsalus
he permitted all the republican leaders who submitted (among
them Cicero), to return to Rome. Even after Thapsus at the intercession
of his friends he pardoned bitter foes like Marcus Marcellus,
one of the consuls of 50 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> But there remained some irreconcilables
led by his old lieutenant Labienus, Varus, and Gnaeus and Sextus
Pompey, sons of Pompey the Great, who after Pharsalus had betaken
<pb n="182"/><anchor id="Pg182"/>themselves with a small naval force to the western Mediterranean.
In 46 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> they were joined by Labienus and Varus and landed in
Spain where they rallied to their cause the old Pompeian soldiers
who had entered Caesar’s service but whose sympathies had been
alienated by one of his <hi rend="italic">legati</hi>, Quintus Cassius. The Caesarian
commanders could make no headway against them and it became
necessary for the dictator to take the field in person. In December
46 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he set out for Spain. Throughout the winter he sought in
vain to force the enemy to battle, but in March 45 the two armies
met at Munda, where Caesar’s eight defeated the thirteen Pompeian
legions. The Caesarians gave no quarter and the Pompeian forces
were annihilated; Labienus and Varus fell on the field, Gnaeus
Pompey was later taken and put to death, but his brother Sextus
escaped. Caesar returned to Italy in September, 45 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, and celebrated
a triumph for his success.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The <anchor id="corr182"/><corr sic="Assassination">assassination</corr> of Julius Caesar, 15 March, 44 B. C.</hi> His
victory at Munda had strengthened Caesar’s autocratic position, and
was responsible for the granting of most of the exceptional honors
which we have noted above. It was now clear at Rome that Caesar
did not intend to restore the republic. In the conduct of the government
he allowed no freedom of action to either Senate or Assembly,
and although in general mild and forgiving he was quick to resent
any attempt to slight him or question his authority. The realization
that Caesar contemplated the establishment of a monarchy aroused
bitter animosity among certain representatives of the old governing
oligarchy, who chafed under the restraints imposed upon them by his
autocratic power and resented the degradation of the Senate to the
position of a mere advisory council. It could hardly be expected
that members of the Roman aristocracy with all their traditions of
imperial government would tamely submit to being excluded from
political life except as ministers of an autocrat who was until lately
one of themselves. This attitude was shared by many who had
hitherto been active in Caesar’s cause, as well as by republicans who
had made their peace with him. And so among these disgruntled
elements a conspiracy was formed against the dictator’s life. The
originator of the plot was the ex-Pompeian Caius Cassius, whom
Caesar had made praetor for 44, and who won over to his design
Marcus Junius Brutus, a member of the house descended from the
Brutus who was reputed to have delivered Rome from the tyranny
<pb n="183"/><anchor id="Pg183"/>of the Tarquins. Brutus had gone over to Caesar after the battle of
Pharsalus and was highly esteemed by him, but allowed himself to be
persuaded that it was his duty to imitate his ancestor’s conduct.
Other conspirators of note were the Caesarians Gaius Trebonius and
Decimus Junius Brutus. In all some sixty senators shared in the
conspiracy. They set the Ides of March, 44, as the date for the
execution of the plot. Caesar was now busily engaged with preparations
for a war against the Parthians, who had been a menace to
Syria ever since the defeat of Crassus. This defeat Caesar aimed to
avenge and, in addition, to definitely secure the eastern frontier of
the empire. An army of sixteen legions and 10,000 cavalry was
being assembled in Greece for this campaign, and Caesar was about
to leave Rome to assume command. He is said to have been informed
that a conspiracy against his life was on foot, but to have disregarded
the warning. He had dismissed his body-guard of soldiers
and refused one of senators and equestrians. On the fatal day he
entered the Senate chamber, where the question of granting him the
title of king in the provinces was to be discussed. A group of the
conspirators surrounded him, and, drawing concealed daggers, stabbed
him to death. He fell at the foot of Pompey’s statue.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Estimate of Caesar’s career.</hi> By the Roman writers who preserved
the republican tradition Brutus, Cassius, and their associates
were honored as tyrannicides who in the name of liberty had sought
to save the republic. Cato, who had died rather than witness the
triumph of Caesar, became their hero. But this is an extremely narrow
and partizan view. The republic which Caesar had overthrown
was no system of popular government but one whereby a small group
of Roman nobles and capitalists exploited for their own personal
ends and for the satisfaction of an idle city mob millions of subjects
in the provinces. The republican organs of government had ceased
to voice the opinion even of the whole Roman citizen body. The
governing circles had proven themselves incapable of bringing about
any improvement in the situation and had completely lost the power
of preserving peace in the state. Radical reforms were imperative
and could only be effective by virtue of superior force. In his resort
to corruption and violence in furthering his own career and in his
appeal to arms to decide the issue between himself and the Senate,
Caesar must be judged according to the practices of his time. He
was the child of his age and advanced himself by means which his
<pb n="184"/><anchor id="Pg184"/>predecessors and contemporaries employed. That he was ambitious
and a lover of power is undeniable but hardly a cause for reproach;
and who shall blame him, if when the Senate sought to destroy him
by force, he used the same means to defend himself. His claim
to greatness lies not in his ability to outwit his rivals in the political
arena or outgeneral his enemies on the field of battle, but in his
realization, when the fate of the civilized world was in his hands,
that the old order was beyond remedy and in his courage in attempting
to set up a new order which promised to give peace and security
both to Roman citizens and to the provincials. Caesar fell before he
had been able to give stability to his organization, but the republic
could not be quickened into life. After Caesar some form of monarchical
government was inevitable.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The political situation after Caesar’s death.</hi> Caesar had
made no arrangements for a successor, and his death produced the
greatest consternation in Rome. The conspirators had made no
plans to seize the reins of power, and instead of finding their act
greeted with an outburst of popular approval, they were left face to
face with the fact that although Caesar was dead the Caesarian party
lived on in his veterans and the city populace, led by the consul
Mark Antony, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Caesar’s master of
the horse. The Senate met on 17 March, and it was evident that
a majority of its members supported the assassins, but they were
afraid of the legion which Lepidus had under his orders and the
Caesarian veterans in the city. Antony, who had obtained possession
of Caesar’s papers and money, took the lead of the Caesarian party
and came to terms with their opponents. It was agreed that the
conspirators should go unpunished, but that the acts of Caesar should
be ratified, even those which had not yet been carried into effect,
that his will should be approved, and that he should receive a public
funeral.
</p>

<p>
The reading of Caesar’s will revealed that he had left his gardens
on the right bank of the Tiber as a public park, had bequeathed
a donation of three hundred sesterces (about fifteen dollars) to each
Roman citizen and had adopted his grand-nephew Caius Octavius
as his son and heir to three-fourths of his fortune. By a speech
delivered to the people on the day of Caesar’s funeral Antony skilfully
enflamed popular sentiment against Caesar’s murderers. The mob
seized the dictator’s corpse, burned it in the forum and buried the
ashes there. The chief conspirators did not dare to remain in the
city; Decimus Brutus went to his province of Cisalpine Gaul, Marcus
Brutus and Cassius lingered in the neighborhood of Rome. Antony
was master of the situation in the capital and overawed opposition
<pb n="186"/><anchor id="Pg186"/>by his bodyguard of 6000 veterans. He held in check Lepidus
and other Caesarians who called for vengeance upon the conspirators.
Lepidus was won over by his election to the position of Pontifex
Maximus to succeed Caesar and was induced to leave the city for
his province of Hither Spain to check the progress of Sextus Pompey,
who had reappeared in Farther Spain and defeated the Caesarian
governor. It was hoped that Sextus would be satisfied with permission
to return to Rome and compensation for his father’s property.
Caesar’s arrangements for the provincial governorships had assigned
Macedonia to Antony and Syria to Dolabella, who became Antony’s
colleague in the consulate at Caesar’s death. This assignment Antony
altered by a law which granted him Cisalpine Gaul and the Transalpine
district outside the Narbonese province for a term of six years
in violation of a law of Caesar’s, which limited proconsular commands
to two years. Dolabella was to have Syria for a like period and
Decimus Brutus was given Macedonia in exchange for Cisalpine
Gaul. The consuls were to occupy their provinces at once. To
Brutus and Cassius were assigned for the next year the provinces of
Crete and Cyrene; while for the present they were given a special
commission to collect grain in Sicily and Asia. The two left Italy
for the East with the intention of seizing the provinces there before
the arrival of Dolabella. They hoped to raise a force which would
enable them to check Antony’s career, for it was evident that Antony
regarded himself as Caesar’s political heir and was planning to
follow the latter’s path to absolute power.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Caius Octavius.</hi> But he found an unexpected rival in the person
of Caesar’s adopted son, Caius Octavius, a youth of eighteen years,
who at the time of Caesar’s death was at Apollonia in Illyricum
with the army that was being assembled for the Parthian War.
Against the advice of his parents he returned to Rome and claimed
his inheritance. His presence was unwelcome to Antony, who had
expended Caesar’s money, and refused to refund it. Thereupon
Octavius raised funds by selling his own properties and borrowing,
and began to pay off the legacies of Caesar. By this means he soon
acquired popularity with the Caesarians. The formalities of his
adoption were not completed until the following year, but from this
time on he took the name of Caesar.<note place="foot">After the adoption his full name was Caius Julius Caesar Octavianus. Although he
was known as Caesar by his contemporaries, it is more convenient to refer to him
henceforth as Octavian, to distinguish him from his adoptive father.</note>
</p>

<pb n="187"/><anchor id="Pg187"/>

<p>
Antony underestimated the capacities of this rather sickly youth
and continued to refuse him recognition, but was soon made aware
of his mistake. He himself was anxious to occupy his province of
Cisalpine Gaul, and since Decimus Brutus refused to evacuate it,
Antony determined to drive him out and obtained permission to recall
for that purpose the four legions from Macedonia. Before their arrival
Octavian raised a force among Caesar’s veterans in Campania,
and on the march from Brundisium to Rome two of the four Macedonian
legions deserted to him. The Caesarians were now divided
into two parties, and Octavian began to coöperate with the republicans
in the Senate. The latter were thus encouraged to oppose Antony
with whom reconciliation was impossible. Cicero, who had not been
among the conspirators but who had subsequently approved Caesar’s
murder, was about to leave Italy to join Brutus when he heard of the
changed situation in Rome and returned to assume the leadership
of the republican party. Antony left Rome for the Cisalpine province
early in December, 44 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, and Cicero induced the Senate to enter
into a coalition with Octavian against him. In his <hi rend="italic">Philippic Orations</hi>
he gave full vent to his bitter hatred of Antony and so aroused the
latter’s undying enmity.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The war at Mutina, December 44–April 43 B. C.</hi> In Cisalpine
Gaul Decimus Brutus, relying upon the support of the Senate, refused
to yield to Antony and was blockaded in Mutina. The Senate made
preparations for his relief. Antony was ordered to leave the province,
and Hirtius and Pansa, who became consuls in January, 43, took
the field against him. The aid of Octavian was indispensable and
the Senate conferred upon him the propraetorian <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> with consular
rank in the Senate. The combined armies defeated Antony
in two battles in the vicinity of Mutina, forcing him to give up the
siege and flee towards Transalpine Gaul. But Pansa died of wounds
received in the first engagement and Hirtius fell in the course of the
second. Ignoring Octavian, the Senate entrusted Brutus with the
command and the task of pursuing Antony. The power of the Senate
seemed reëstablished, for Marcus Brutus and Cassius had succeeded
in their design of getting control of the eastern provinces, Dolabella
having perished in the conflict, and were at the head of a considerable
military and naval force. The Senate accordingly conferred upon
them supreme military authority (<hi rend="italic">maius imperium</hi>), and gave to
Sextus Pompey, then at Massalia, a naval command. At last Cicero
<pb n="188"/><anchor id="Pg188"/>could induce the senators to declare Antony a public enemy. He
no longer felt the support of Octavian a necessity and expressed the
attitude of the republicans towards him in the saying <q>the young
man is to be praised, to be honored, to be set aside.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend="italic">Laudandum adulescentem, ornandum, tolendum</hi>, Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Fam.</hi>, xi, 20, 1.</note> But it was
soon evident that the experienced orator had entirely misjudged this
young man who, so far from being the tool of the Senate, had used
that body for his own ends. Octavian refused to aid Decimus
Brutus, and demanded from the Senate his own appointment as consul,
a triumph, and rewards for his troops. His demands were rejected,
whereupon he marched upon Rome with his army, and occupied
the city. On 19 August, he had himself elected consul with
Quintus Pedius as his colleague. The latter carried a bill which
established a special court for the trial of Caesar’s murderers, who
were condemned and banished. The same penalty was pronounced
upon Sextus Pompey. The Senate’s decree against Antony was
revoked.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Triumvirate, 43 B. C.</hi> On his way to Transalpine Gaul
Antony had met with Lepidus, whom the Senate had summoned
from Spain to the assistance of Decimus Brutus. But Lepidus was
a Caesarian and, alarmed by the success of Marcus Brutus and Cassius,
allowed his troops to go over to Antony. Decimus Brutus had
taken up the pursuit of Antony and joined forces with Plancus, governor
of Narbonese Gaul. However, upon news of the events in
Rome, Plancus abandoned Brutus and joined Antony. Brutus was
deserted by his troops and killed while a fugitive in Gaul.
</p>
            </div><div>
     <index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="II. The Triumvirate of 43 B. C."/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. The Triumvirate of 43 b. c.</hi></head>

<p>
Octavian had taken care to have the defense of Italy against
Antony and Lepidus entrusted to himself, and hastened northwards
to meet the advance of their forces. But both sides were ready to
come to terms and unite their forces for the purpose of crushing their
common enemies, Brutus and Cassius. Accordingly, at a conference
of the three leaders on an island in the river Renus near Bononia,
a reconciliation between Antony and Octavian was effected and plans
laid for their coöperation in the immediate future. The three decided
to have themselves appointed triumvirs for the settlement of the
commonwealth (<hi rend="italic">triumviri reipublicae <anchor id="corr188"/><corr sic="constituandae">constituendae</corr></hi>) for a term of
<pb n="189"/><anchor id="Pg189"/>five years. They were to have consular <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> with the right to
appoint to the magistracies and their acts were to be valid without
the approval of the Senate. Furthermore, they divided among themselves
the western provinces; Antony received those previously assigned
to him, Lepidus took the Spains and Narbonese Gaul;
while to Octavian fell Sardinia, Sicily and Africa. Octavian was
to resign his consulship, but in the next year to be joint commander
with Antony in a campaign against the republican armies in the East
while Lepidus protected their interests in Rome. The triumvirate
was legalized by a tribunician law (the <hi rend="italic">lex Titia</hi>) of 27 November,
43, and its members formally entered upon office on the first of
January following. Unlike the secret coalition of Pompey, Crassus
and Caesar, the present one constituted a commission clothed with
almost supreme public powers.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Proscriptions.</hi> The formation of the coalition was followed by
the proscription of the enemies of the triumvirs, partly for the sake
of vengeance but largely to secure money for their troops from the
confiscation of the properties of the proscribed. Among the chief
victims was Cicero, whose death Antony demanded. He died with
courage for the sake of the republican ideal to which he was devoted,
but it must be recognized that this devotion was to the cause of a
corrupt aristocracy, whose crimes he refused to share, although he
forced himself to condone and justify them. The exactions of the
triumvirs did not end with the confiscation of the goods of the proscribed;
special taxes were laid upon the propertied classes in Italy
and eighteen of the most flourishing Italian municipalities were
marked out as sites for colonies of veterans.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Divus Julius.</hi> In 42 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Octavian dedicated a temple to Julius
Caesar in the forum where his body had been burned. Later by a
special law Caesar was elevated among the gods of the Roman state
with the name of Divus Julius. Meanwhile Octavian had found
difficulty in occupying his allotted provinces. Africa was eventually
conquered by one of his lieutenants, but Sextus Pompey, who controlled
the sea, had occupied Sardinia and Sicily. His forces were
augmented by many of the proscribed and by adventurers of all sorts,
and Octavian could not dislodge him before setting out against Brutus
and Cassius.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Philippi, 42 B. C.</hi> These republican generals had raised an army
of 80,000 troops, in addition to allied contingents, and taken up a
<pb n="190"/><anchor id="Pg190"/>position in Thrace to await the attack of the triumvirs. In the summer
of 42 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the latter transported their troops across the Adriatic
in spite of the fleet of their enemies, and the two armies faced each
other near Philippi on the borders of Macedonia and Thrace. An
indecisive battle was fought in which Antony defeated Cassius, who
committed suicide in despair, but Brutus routed the troops commanded
by Octavian. Shortly afterwards Brutus was forced by his soldiers
to risk another battle. This time he was completely defeated, and
took his own life.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The division of the Empire.</hi> The triumvirs now redistributed
the provinces among themselves, Cisalpine Gaul was incorporated
in Italy, whose political boundaries at length coincided with its geographical
frontier. The whole of Transalpine Gaul was given to
Antony, Octavian received the two Spains, while Lepidus was forced
to content himself with Africa. He was suspected by his colleagues
of having intrigued with Sextus Pompey, and they were now in a
position to weaken him at the risk of his open hostility. From the
time of the meeting near Bononia Antony had been the chief personage
in the coalition and his prestige was enhanced by his success at
Philippi. It was now agreed that he should settle conditions in the
eastern provinces and raise funds there, while Octavian should return
to Italy and carry out the promised assignment of lands to their troops.
This decision was of momentous consequence for the future. In the
summer of 41 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Antony received a visit from Cleopatra at Tarsus
in Cilicia. Her personal charms and keen intelligence, which had
enthralled the great Julius, exercised an even greater fascination over
Antony, whose cardinal weaknesses were indolence and sensual indulgence.
He followed Cleopatra to Egypt, where he remained until 40 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Octavian in Italy, 42–40 B. C.</hi> In Italy Octavian was confronted
with the task of providing lands for some 170,000 veterans.
The eighteen municipalities previously selected for this purpose proved
insufficient, and a general confiscation of small holdings took place,
whereby many persons were rendered homeless and destitute. Few,
like the poet Virgil, found compensation through the influence of a
powerful patron. A heavy blow was dealt to the prosperity of Italy.
The task of Octavian was greatly hampered by opposition from the
friends of Antony, led by the latter’s wife Fulvia and his brother
Lucius Antonius. Hostilities broke out in which Lucius was
be<pb n="191"/><anchor id="Pg191"/>sieged in Perusia and starved into submission (40 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). Fulvia
went to join Antony, while others of their faction fled to Sextus
Pompey who still held Sicily. Of great importance to Octavian
was his acquisition of Gaul which came into his hands through the
death of Antony’s legate, Calenus. An indication of the approaching
break between Octavian and Antony was the former’s divorce of his
wife Clodia, and his marriage with Scribonia, a relative of Sextus
Pompey, whom he hoped to win over to his side.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Treaty of Brundisium, 40 B. C.</hi> While Octavian had been involved
in the Perusian war, the Parthians had overrun the province
of Syria, and in conjunction with them Quintus Labienus, a follower
of Brutus and Cassius, penetrated Asia Minor as far as the Aegean
coast. Antony thereupon returned to Italy to gather troops to
reëstablish Roman authority in the East. Both he and Octavian
were prepared for war and hostilities began around Brundisium,
which refused Antony admittance. However, a reconciliation was
effected, and an agreement entered into which was known as the
treaty of Brundisium. It was provided that Octavian should have
Spain, Gaul, Sardinia, Sicily and Dalmatia, while Antony should
hold the Roman possessions east of the Ionian sea; Lepidus retained
Africa, and Italy was to be held in common. To cement the alliance
Antony, whose wife Fulvia had died, married Octavia, sister of
Octavian.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The treaty of Misenum, 39 B. C.</hi> In the following year Antony
and Octavian were forced to come to terms with Sextus Pompey.
He still defiantly held Sicily and in addition wrested Sardinia from
Octavian. His command of these islands and of the seas about Italy
enabled him to cut off the grain supply of Rome, where a famine broke
out. This brought about a meeting of the three at Misenum in which
it was agreed that Sextus should govern Sardinia, Sicily and Achaia
for five years, should be consul and augur, and receive a monetary
compensation for his father’s property in Rome. In return he engaged
to secure peace at sea and convoy the grain supply for the
city. However, the terms of the treaty were never fully carried out
and in the next year Octavian and Sextus were again at war. The
former regained possession of Sardinia but failed in an attack upon
Sicily.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Treaty of Tarentum, 37 B. C.</hi> Meanwhile Antony had returned
to the East where in the years 39–37 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> his lieutenants won back
<pb n="192"/><anchor id="Pg192"/>the Asiatic provinces from Labienus and the Parthians and drove the
latter beyond the Euphrates. He now resolved to carry out the plan
of Julius Caesar for the conquest of the Parthian kingdom. This
necessitated his return to Italy to secure reinforcements. But, his
landing was opposed by Octavian who was angry because Antony
had not supported him against Sextus Pompey, whom Antony evidently
regarded as a useful check upon his colleague’s power. However,
Octavia managed to reconcile her brother and her husband, and
the two reached a new agreement at Tarentum. Here it was arranged
that Antony should supply Octavian with one hundred ships for
operations against Pompey, that Lepidus should coöperate in the
attack upon Sicily, and that both he and Octavian should furnish
Antony with soldiers for the Parthian war. As the power of the
triumvirs had legally lapsed on 31 December, 38 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, they decided to
have themselves reappointed for another five years, which would
terminate at the close of 33 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> This appointment like the first
was carried into effect by a special law.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The defeat of Sextus Pompey, 36 B. C.</hi> Octavian now energetically
pressed his attack upon Sicily, while Lepidus coöperated
by besieging Lilybaeum. At length, in September, 36 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Marcus
Vipsanius Agrippa, Octavian’s ablest general, destroyed the bulk of
Pompey’s fleet in a battle off Naulochus. Pompey fled to Asia, where
two years later he was captured by Antony’s forces and executed.
After the flight of Sextus, Lepidus challenged Octavian’s claim to
Sicily, but his troops deserted him for Octavian and he was forced to
throw himself upon the latter’s mercy. Stripped of his power and
retaining only his office of chief pontiff, he lived under guard in
an Italian municipality until his death in 12 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> His provinces
were taken by Octavian. The defeat of Sextus Pompey and the
deposition of Lepidus gave Octavian sole power over the western half
of the empire, and inevitably tended to sharpen the rivalry and antagonism
which had long existed between himself and Antony. In the
same year Octavian was granted the tribunician sacrosanctity and the
right to sit on the tribune’s bench in the Senate.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. The Victory of Octavian <anchor id="corr192"/><corr sic="Over">over</corr> Antony and Cleopatra</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Parthian war, 36 B. C.</hi> After the Treaty of Tarentum
Antony proceeded to Syria to begin preparations for his campaign
against the Parthians which he began in 36 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Avoiding the
<pb n="193"/><anchor id="Pg193"/>Mesopotamian desert, he marched to the north through Armenia into
Media Atropatene in the hope of surprising the enemy. However,
having met with a repulse in his siege of the fortress Phraata (or
Praaspa), he was forced to retreat. He was vigorously pursued by
the Parthians, but by skilful generalship managed to conduct the
bulk of his army back to Armenia. Still he lost over 20,000 of
his troops, and his reputation suffered severely from the complete
failure of the undertaking. And so he prepared once more to take
the offensive. As he attributed the failure of the late expedition to
the disloyalty of the king of Armenia, Antony marched against him,
treacherously took him prisoner and occupied his kingdom (34
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). Thereupon he entered into an alliance with the king of
Media Atropatene, a vassal of Parthia, and formed ambitious projects
for the conquest of the eastern provinces of the empires of Alexander
the great and the Seleucids. But these plans could only be executed
with the help of the military resources of Italy and the western
provinces that were now completely in the hands of Octavian. In
view of the jealousy existing between the two triumvirs it was not
likely that Octavian would willingly provide Antony with the means
to increase his power, and so the latter was prepared to resort to
force to make good his claim upon Italy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Antony and Cleopatra.</hi> Another factor in the quarrel was
Antony’s connection with Cleopatra. While in Antioch in 36 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
he openly married Cleopatra, and in the next year refused his legal
wife, Octavia, permission to join him. This was equivalent to
publicly renouncing his friendship with Octavian. Although it cannot
be said that Antony had become a mere tool of Cleopatra, he
was completely won over to her plans for the future of Egypt; namely,
that since Egypt must sooner or later be incorporated in the Roman
empire, this should be brought about by her union with the ruler
of the Romans. Consequently, since her marriage with Antony she
actively supported his ambition to be the successor of Julius Caesar.
Their aims were clearly revealed by a pageant staged in Alexandria
in 34 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, in which Antony and Cleopatra appeared as the god
Dionysus and the goddess Isis, seated on golden thrones. In an
address to the assembled public Antony proclaimed Cleopatra <q>queen
of queens,</q> and ruler of Egypt, Cyprus, Crete and Coele-Syria; joint
ruler with her was Ptolemy Caesarion, the son she had borne to
Caesar. The two young sons of Antony and Cleopatra were
pro<pb n="194"/><anchor id="Pg194"/>claimed <q>kings of kings</q>; the elder as king of Armenia, Media
and the Parthians, the younger as king of Syria, Phoenicia and
Cilicia. To their daughter, Cleopatra, was assigned Cyrene. These
arrangements aroused great mistrust and hostility towards Antony
among the Romans, who resented the partition of Rome’s eastern
provinces in the interest of oriental potentates. Relying upon this
sentiment, Octavian in 33 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> refused Antony’s demands for troops
and joint authority in Italy. Antony at once postponed the resumption
of the Parthian war and prepared to march against his rival.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The outbreak of hostilities, 32 B. C.</hi> The final break came
early in 32 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> The triumvirate legally terminated with the close
of 33 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> and two consuls of Antony’s faction came into office for
the following year. To win support in Rome, Antony wrote to the
Senate offering to surrender his powers as triumvir and restore the
old constitution. His friends introduced a proposal that Octavian
should surrender his <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> at once, but this was vetoed by a
tribune. Octavian then took charge of affairs in Rome, and the
consuls, not daring to oppose him, fled to Antony, accompanied by
many senators of his party. Thereupon Octavian caused the Assembly
to abrogate the former’s <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> and also his appointment to
the consulship for 31 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> To justify his actions and convince the
Italians of the danger which threatened them from the alliance of
Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian seized and published Antony’s will
which had been deposited in the temple of Vesta. The will confirmed
the disposition which he had made of the eastern provinces
in the interest of the house of Cleopatra. Octavian was now able
to bring about a declaration of war against the Egyptian queen and
to exact an oath of loyalty to himself from the senators in Rome and
from the municipalities of Italy and the western provinces. It was
this oath of allegiance which was the main basis of his authority for
the next few years. In reply to these measures, Antony formally
divorced Octavia and refused to recognize the validity of the laws
which deprived him of his powers.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Actium, 31 B. C.</hi> In the fall of 33 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Antony and Cleopatra
began assembling their forces in Greece with the intention of invading
Italy. By the next year they had brought together an army of about
100,000 men, supported by a fleet of 500 ships of war. However,
no favorable occasion for attempting a landing in Italy presented
itself and both the fleet and the army went into winter quarters in the
<pb n="195"/><anchor id="Pg195"/>gulf of Ambracia (32–1 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). In the spring of 31 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Octavian
with 80,000 men and 400 warships crossed over to Epirus and took
up a position facing his opponents who had taken their station in the
bay of Actium at the entrance to the gulf of Ambracia. His most
capable general was Agrippa. Owing to discord which had arisen
between Cleopatra and his Roman officers, Antony remained inactive
while detachments of Octavian’s forces won over important points in
Greece. Antony began to suffer from a shortage of supplies and
some of his influential followers deserted to the opposite camp. At
length he risked a naval battle, in the course of which Cleopatra and
the Egyptian squadron set sail for Egypt and Antony followed her.
His fleet was defeated and his army, which attempted to retreat to
Macedonia, was forced to surrender. There is little doubt that Cleopatra
had for some time been contemplating treachery to Antony,
and her desertion was probably based on the calculation that if
Octavian should prove victorious she would be able to claim credit
for her services, while if Antony should be the victor, she was confident
of obtaining pardon for her conduct. Probably she did not
anticipate that Antony would join her in flight. At any rate, when
Antony abandoned his still undefeated fleet and army he sealed both
his fate and hers. The victor advanced slowly eastwards and in the
summer of 30 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> began his invasion of Egypt. Antony’s attempts
at defense were unavailing; his troops went over to Octavian who
occupied Alexandria. In despair he committed suicide. For a time
Cleopatra, who had frustrated Antony’s last attempt at resistance,
hoped to win over Octavian as she had won Caesar and Antony, so
that she might save at least Egypt for her dynasty. But finding her
efforts unavailing, she poisoned herself rather than grace Octavian’s
triumph. The kingdom of Egypt was added to the Roman empire,
not as a province but as part of an estate to be directly administered
by the ruler of the Roman world who took his place as the heir of
the Pharaohs and the Ptolemies. The treasures of Egypt reimbursed
Octavian for the expenses of his late campaigns. After reëstablishing
the old provinces and client kingdoms in the East, Octavian returned
to Rome in 29 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, where he celebrated a three-day triumph
over the non-Roman peoples of Europe, Asia and Africa, whom he or
his generals had subjugated during his triumvirate.
</p>

<p>
At the age of thirty-three Octavian had made good his claim to
the political inheritance of Julius Caesar. His victory over Antony
<pb n="196"/><anchor id="Pg196"/>closed the century of civil strife which had begun with the tribunate
of Tiberius Gracchus. War and the proscriptions had exacted a
heavy toll from Romans and Italians; Greece, Macedonia and Asia
had been brought to the verge of ruin; the whole empire longed for
peace. Everywhere was Octavian hailed as the savior of the world
and, as the founder of a new golden age, men were ready to worship
him as a god.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">IV. Society and Intellectual Life in the Last Century
of the Republic</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The upper classes.</hi> The characteristics of Roman society in the
last century of the republic are the same which we have previously
seen developing as a result of Rome’s imperial expansion. The upper
classes of society comprise the senatorial nobility and the equestrians;
the former finding their goal in public office, the latter in banking
and financial ventures, and both alike callously exploiting the subjects
of Rome in their own interests. Of this one example will suffice.
Marcus Brutus, the conspirator, who enjoyed a high repute for his
honorable character, loaned money to the cities of Cyprus at the
exorbitant rate of 48% and influenced the senate to declare the contract
valid. He did not hesitate to secure for his agents military
authority with which to enforce payment, and was much disappointed
when Cicero, as governor of Cilicia and Cyprus, refused to give his
representative such power or to allow him to collect more than 12%
interest on his debt.
</p>

<p>
As corruption characterized the public, so did extravagance and
luxury the private life of the governing classes. The palaces of the
wealthy in Rome were supplemented by villas in the Sabine hills,
in the watering places of the Campanian coast, and other attractive
points. The word villa, which originally designated a farm house,
now meant a country seat equipped with all the modern conveniences
of city life.
</p>

<p>
The solidarity of the family life which had been the foundation
of Roman morality was fast disappearing. In general, wives no
longer came under the authority (<hi rend="italic">manus</hi>) of their husbands upon
marriage, and so retained control of their properties acquired by inheritance
or dowry through a guardian from their own families. Consequently
women played an increasingly independent and important
<pb n="197"/><anchor id="Pg197"/>part in the society of the day. In Rome at least the age was one
of a low tone in morals, and divorces were of common occurrence.
At the same time social intercourse was characterized by a high degree
of urbanity—the good manners which mark the society of cultured
men.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The plebs.</hi> Of the life of the plebs who thronged the high tenement
houses and narrow streets of Rome we know very little. But
until the Assembly was overawed or superseded by armed forces the
city populace could not be ignored by the upper classes. Their votes
must be courted by magnificent displays at the public games, by
entertainments and largesses of all kinds, and care must be taken to
provide them with food to prevent their becoming a menace to the
public peace. This latter problem was solved as we have seen
after the time of Caius Gracchus by providing them with a monthly
allowance of corn, at first at a greatly reduced price, but after 57
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> gratuitously. Julius Caesar found about 320,000 persons sharing
in this distribution, and reduced the number to 150,000 male citizens.
The city mob thus became to a certain degree state pensioners,
and placed a heavy burden on the treasury. There can be no doubt
that the ranks of the urban proletariat were swelled by peasants who
had lost their holdings in the course of the civil wars and the settlements
of discharged soldiers on Italian soil, but the chief increase
came from the manumission of slaves, who as <hi rend="italic">liberti</hi> or freedmen
became Roman citizens. Sulla’s 10,000 Cornelii were of this number.
The influx of these heterogeneous elements radically changed the
character of the city populace which could no longer claim to be
mainly of Roman and Italian stock but embraced representatives of
all races of the Mediterranean world. The population was further
augmented by the great numbers of slaves attached to the houses of
the wealthy or engaged in various industrial occupations for their
masters or others who hired their services.
</p>

<p>
In the rural districts of Italy the plantation system had been widely
extended and agriculture and grazing were in the main carried on by
slave labor. Yet the free farmers had by no means entirely disappeared
and free labor was employed even on the <hi rend="italic">latifundia</hi> themselves.
The discharged veterans who were provided with lands attest the
presence of considerable numbers of free landholders.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Religion.</hi> In religion this period witnessed a striking decline of
interest and faith in the public religion of the Roman state. This
<pb n="198"/><anchor id="Pg198"/>was in part due to the influence of Greek mythology which changed
the current conceptions of the Roman divinities and to Greek philosophy
with its varying doctrines as to the nature and powers of the
gods. The latter especially affected the upper classes of society upon
whom fell the duty of maintaining the public cults. From the time
of the Gracchi the public priesthoods declined in importance; and
in many cases they were used solely as a tool for political purposes.
The increase in the numbers of the priestly colleges and the substitution
of election for coöptation brought in many members unversed in
the ancient traditions, and the holders of the priesthoods in general
showed great ignorance of their duties, especially with regard to the
ordering of the state calendar. Some religious associations like the
Arval Brotherhood ceased to exist and knowledge of the character
of some of the minor deities was completely lost. The patrician
priesthoods, which involved serious duties and restricted the freedom
of their incumbents were avoided as much as possible. At the same
time the private religious rites, hereditary within family groups, fell
into decay. While the attitude of educated circles towards the state
cults was thus one of indifference or skepticism, it is hard to speak
of that of the common people. Superstitious they were beyond a
doubt, but in the performance of the state cults they had never
actively participated. The more emotional cults of the oriental type
made a greater appeal to them if we may judge from the difficulty
which the Senate experienced in banishing the priests of Isis from
the city.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Stoicism and Epicureanism.</hi> The philosophic systems which
made the most converts among the educated Romans were Stoicism
and Epicureanism. The former, as we have seen, had been introduced
to Rome by Panaetius, whose teaching was continued by
Posidonius. It appealed to the Romans as offering a practical rule
of life for men engaged in public affairs. On the other hand, the
doctrine of Epicurus that men should withdraw from the annoyances
of political life and seek happiness in the pursuit of pleasure, that is,
intellectual pleasure, was interpreted by the Roman as sanctioning
sensual indulgence and became the creed of those who gave themselves
up to a life of ease and indolence.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Literature.</hi> The last century of the republic saw the completion
of the amalgamation of Greek and Roman culture which had begun
in the previous epoch. The resulting Graeco-Roman culture was a
<pb n="199"/><anchor id="Pg199"/>bi-lingual civilization based upon Greek intellectual and Roman
political achievement which it was the mission of the empire to
spread to the barbaric peoples of the western provinces. The age
was marked by many-sided, keen, intellectual activity which brought
Rome’s intellectual development to its height. Yet this Graeco-Roman
culture was almost exclusively a possession of the higher classes.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The drama.</hi> In the field of dramatic literature the writing of
tragedy practically ceased and comedy took the popular forms of
caricature (<hi rend="italic">fabula Atellana</hi>) and the mime, or realistic imitation
of the life of the lower classes. Both forms were derived from Greek
prototypes but dealt with subjects of everyday life and won great
popularity in the theatrical exhibitions given at the public games.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Poetry: Catullus, 87–c. 54 B. C.</hi> The best exponent of the poetry
of the age is Catullus, a native of Verona in Cisalpine Gaul, who as a
young man was drawn into the vortex of fashionable society at the
capital. This new poetry appealed to a highly educated class, conversant
alike with the literature of the Greek classic and Hellenistic
periods as well as with modern production, and able to appreciate
the most elaborate and diversified meters. The works of Catullus
show the wide range of form and subject which appealed to contemporary
taste. Translations and copies of Greek originals find
their place alongside epigrams and lyric poems of personal experience.
It is his poetry of passion, of love and hate, which places him among
the foremost lyric poets of all time.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Lucretius, 98–53 B. C.</hi> An exception among the poets of his time
was Lucretius, who combined the spirit of a poet with that of a
religious teacher. He felt a mission to free the minds of men from
fear of the power of the gods and of death. To this end he wrote
a didactic epic poem, <hi rend="italic">On the Nature of Things</hi>, in which he explained
the atomic theory of Democritus which was the foundation
of the philosophical teachings of Epicurus. The essence of this doctrine
was that the world and all living creatures were produced by
the fortuitous concourse of atoms falling through space and that death
was simply the dissolution of the body into its component atomic elements.
Consequently, there was no future existence to be dreaded.
True poetic value is given to the work by the author’s great imaginative
powers and his keen observation of nature and human life.
Lucretius made the Latin hexameter a fitting medium for the expression
of sustained and lofty thought.
</p>

<pb n="200"/><anchor id="Pg200"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Oratory.</hi> It was through the study and practice of oratory that
Roman prose attained its perfection between the time of the Gracchi
and Julius Caesar. Political and legal orations were weapons in the
party strife of the day and were frequently polished and edited as
political pamphlets. Along with political documents of this type appeared
orations that were not written to be delivered in the forum or
senate chamber but were addressed solely to a reading public. Among
the great forensic orators of the age were the two Gracchi, of whom
the younger, Caius, had the reputation of being the most effective
speaker that Rome ever knew. Others of note were Marcus Antonius,
grandfather of the triumvir, Lucius Licinius Crassus, and Quintus
Hortensius Hortalus. But it was Cicero who brought to its perfection
the Roman oration in its literary form.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Cicero, 106–43 B. C.</hi> Cicero was beyond question the intellectual
leader of his day. He was above all things an orator and until past
the age of fifty his literary productivity was almost entirely in that
field. In his latter years he undertook the great task of making
Hellenistic philosophy accessible to the Roman world through the
medium of Latin prose. In addition to his speeches and oratorical
and philosophic treatises Cicero left to posterity a great collection of
letters which were collected and published after his death by his
freedman secretary. His correspondence with his friends is a mine
of information for the student of society and politics in the last century
of the republic.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Caesar, 100–44 B. C.</hi> Julius Caesar made his genius felt in the
world of letters as well as of politics. Though an orator of high
rank, he is better known as the author of his lucid commentaries on
the Gallic war and on the Civil war, which present the view that
he desired the Roman public to take of his conflict with the senate.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Sallust, 86–36 B. C.</hi> Foremost among historical writers of the
period was Caius Sallustius Crispus, <q>the first scientific Roman historian.</q>
Subsequent generations ranked him as the greatest Roman
historian. His chief work, a history of the period 78–67 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, is
almost entirely lost, but two shorter studies on the Jugurthine war
and Cataline’s conspiracy have been preserved. In contrast to Cicero,
he is the protagonist of Caesarianism.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Varro, 116–27 B. C.</hi> Of great interest to later ages were the works
of the antiquarian and philologist, Marcus Terentius Varro, the most
learned Roman of his time. His great work on Roman religious and
<pb n="201"/><anchor id="Pg201"/>political antiquities has been lost, but a part of his study <hi rend="italic">On the
Latin Language</hi> is still extant, as well as his three books <hi rend="italic">On Rural
Conditions</hi>. The latter give a good picture of agricultural conditions
in Italy towards the end of the republic.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Jurisprudence.</hi> To legal literature considerable contributions
were made both in the domain of applied law and of legal theory.
We have already noticed the appeal which the Stoic philosophy made
to the best that was in Roman character and many of the leading
Roman jurists accepted its principles. It was natural then that
Roman legal philosophy should begin under the influence of the Stoic
doctrine of a universal divine law ruling the world, this law being an
emanation of right reason, i. e. the divine power governing the universe.
The most influential legal writers of the period were Quintus
Mucius Scaevola who compiled a systematic treatment of the civil
law in eighteen books, and Servius Sulpicius Rufus, the contemporary
of Cicero. Sulpicius was a most productive author, whose works included
<hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> on the XII Tables, and on the Praetor’s Edict,
as well as studies on special aspects of Roman law.

<hi rend="bold">The settlement of 27 B. C.</hi> During his sixth and seventh consulships,
in the years 28 and 27 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Octavian surrendered the
extraordinary powers which he had exercised during the war against
Antony and Cleopatra and, as he later expressed it, placed the commonwealth
at the disposal of the Senate and the Roman people. But
this step did not imply that the old machinery of government was
to be restored without modifications and restrictions or that Octavian
intended to abdicate his position as arbiter of the fate of the Roman
world. Nor would he have been justified in so doing, for such a
course of action would have led to a repetition of the anarchy which
followed the retirement and death of Sulla, and, in disposing of his
rivals, Octavian had assumed the obligation of giving to the Roman
world a stable form of government. Public sentiment demanded a
strong administration, even if this could only be attained at the expense
of the old republican institutions.
</p>

<p>
But while ambition and duty alike forbade him to relinquish his
hold upon the helm of state, Octavian shrank from realizing the ideal
of Julius Caesar and establishing a monarchical form of government.
From this he was deterred both by the fate of his adoptive father and
his own cautious, conservative character which gave him such a shrewd
understanding of Roman temperament. His solution of the problem
was to retain the old Roman constitution as far as was practicable,
while securing for himself such powers as would enable him to uphold
the constitution and prevent a renewal of the disorders of the preceding
century. What powers were necessary to this end, Octavian determined
on the basis of practical experience between 27 and 18 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
And so his restoration of the commonwealth signified the end of a
régime of force and paved the way for his reception of new authority
legally conferred upon him.
</p>

<pb n="206"/><anchor id="Pg206"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The imperium.</hi> Nothing had contributed more directly to the
failure of the republican form of government than the growth of the
professional army and the inability of the Senate to control its commanders.
Therefore, it was absolutely necessary for the guardian of
peace and of the constitution to concentrate the supreme military
authority in his own hands. Consequently on 13 January, 27 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>,
the birthday of the new order, Octavian, by vote of the Assembly
and Senate, received for a period of ten years the command and
administration of the provinces of Hither Spain, Gaul and Syria,
that is, the chief provinces in which peace was not yet firmly established
and which consequently required the presence of the bulk of
the Roman armies. Egypt, over which he had ruled as the successor
of the Ptolemies since 30 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, remained directly subject to his authority.
As long as he continued to hold the consulship, the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>
of Octavian was senior (<hi rend="italic">maius</hi>) to that of the governors of the other
provinces which remained under the control of the Senate. In effect,
his solution of the military problem was to have conferred upon himself
an extraordinary command which found its precedents in those
of Lucullus, Pompey and Caesar, but which was of such scope and
duration that it made him the commander-in-chief of the forces of
the empire.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The titles Augustus and Imperator.</hi> On 16 January of the
same year the Senate conferred upon Octavian the title of Augustus
(Greek, <hi rend="italic">Sebastos</hi>) by which he was henceforth regularly designated.
It was a term which implied no definite powers, but, being an epithet
equally applicable to gods or men, was well adapted to express the
exalted position of its bearer. A second title was that of Imperator.
Following the republican custom, this had been conferred upon Augustus
by his army and the Senate after his victory at Mutina in 43 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>,
and in imitation of Julius Caesar he converted this temporary title
of honor into a permanent one. Finally, in 38 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, he placed it first
among his personal names (as a <hi rend="italic">praenomen</hi>). After 27 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Augustus
made a two-fold use of the term; as a permanent <hi rend="italic">praenomen</hi>, and
as a title of honor assumed upon the occasion of victories won by his
officers. From this time the <hi rend="italic">praenomen</hi> Imperator was a prerogative
of the Roman commander-in-chief. However, during his principate
Augustus did not stress its use, since he did not wish to emphasize
the military basis of his power. But in the Greek-speaking
provinces, where his power rested exclusively upon his military
author<pb n="207"/><anchor id="Pg207"/>ity, the title Imperator was seized upon as the expression of his unlimited
<hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> and was translated in that sense by <hi rend="italic">autocrator</hi>.
From the <hi rend="italic">praenomen</hi> imperator is derived the term emperor, commonly
used in modern times to designate Augustus and his successors.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The tribunicia potestas, 23 B. C.</hi> From 27 to 23 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the
authority of Augustus rested upon his annual tenure of the consulship
and his provincial command. But in the summer of 23 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he
resigned the consulship and received from the Senate and people the
tribunician authority (<hi rend="italic">tribunicia potestas</hi>) for life. As early as 36
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he had been granted the personal inviolability of the tribunes,
and in 30 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> their right of giving aid (<hi rend="italic">auxilium</hi>). To these privileges
there must now have been added the right of intercession and
of summoning the <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> (<hi rend="italic">jus agendi cum populo</hi>).<note place="foot">In this I follow Dio. xlix, 15, 6; li, 19, 6 and liii, 32, 5 and 6.</note> In this way
Augustus acquired a control over comitial and senatorial legislation
and openly assumed the position of protector of the interests of the
city plebs. He was moreover amply compensated for the loss of
civil power which his resignation of the consulship involved, and
at the same time he got rid of an office which must be shared with a
colleague of equal rank and the perpetual tenure of which was a
violation of constitutional tradition. The tribunician authority was
regarded as being held for successive annual periods, which Augustus
reckoned from 23 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Special powers and honors.</hi> At the time of the conferment of
the tribunician authority, a series of senatorial decrees added or gave
greater precision to the powers of Augustus. He received the right
to introduce the first topic for consideration at each meeting of the
Senate, his military <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> was made valid within the <hi rend="italic">pomerium</hi>,
but, in view of his resignation of the consulship, became proconsular
in the provinces. It was probably in 23 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> also that Augustus
received the unrestricted right of making war or peace, upon the
occasion of the coming of an embassy from the king of the Parthians.
In the next year he was granted the right to call meetings of the
Senate. Three years later he was accorded the consular insignia,
with twelve lictors, and the privilege of taking his seat on a curule
chair between the consuls in office. These marks of honor gave him
upon official occasions the precedence among the magistrates which
his authority warranted. On the other hand, in 22 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Augustus
refused the dictatorship or the perpetual consulship, which were
con<pb n="208"/><anchor id="Pg208"/>ferred upon him at the insistence of the city populace; and in the same
spirit he declined to accept a general censorship of laws and morals
(<hi rend="italic">cura legum et morum</hi>) which was proffered to him in 19 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The principate.</hi> It was by the gradual acquisition of the above
powers that the position which Augustus was to hold in the state was
finally determined. This position may be defined as that of a magistrate,
whose province was a combination of various powers conferred
upon him by the Senate and the Roman people, and who differed from
the other magistrates of the state in the immensely wider scope of his
functions and the greater length of his official term. But these
various powers were separately conferred upon him and for each
he could urge constitutional precedents. It was in this spirit of
deference to constitutional traditions that Augustus did not create for
himself one new office which would have given him the same authority
nor accept any position that would have clothed him with autocratic
power. Therefore, as he held no definite office, Augustus had no
definite official title. But the reception of such wide powers caused
him to surpass all other Romans in dignity; hence he came to be
designated as the <hi rend="italic">princeps</hi>, i. e. the first of the Roman citizens
(<hi rend="italic">princeps civium Romanorum</hi>). From this arose the term principate
to designate the tenure of office of the princeps; a term which we now
apply also to the system of government that Augustus established for
the Roman Empire. The crowning honor of his career was received
by Augustus in 2 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, when the senate, upon the motion of one who
had fought under Brutus at Philippi, conferred upon him the title
of <q>Father of His Country</q> (<hi rend="italic">pater patriae</hi>), thus marking the reconciliation
between the bulk of the old aristocracy and the new régime.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Renewal of the imperium.</hi> His <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>, which lapsed in 18
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Augustus caused to be reconferred upon himself for successive
periods of five or ten years, thus preserving the continuity of his
power until his death in 14 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. The Senate, the Equestrians and the Plebs</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The three orders.</hi> The social classification of the Romans into
the senatorial, equestrian and plebeian orders passed, with sharper
definitions, from the republic into the principate. For each class a
distinct field of opportunity and public service was opened; for senators,
the magistracies and the chief military posts; for the <hi rend="italic">equites</hi> a
<pb n="209"/><anchor id="Pg209"/>new career in the civil and military service of the princeps, and for
the plebs service as privates and subaltern officers in the professional
army. However, these orders were by no means closed castes; the
way lay open to able and successful men for advancement from the
lower to the higher grades, and for the consequent infusion of fresh
vitality into the ranks of the latter.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Senate and the senatorial order.</hi> The senatorial order
was composed of the members of the Senate and their families. Its
distinctive emblem was the broad purple stripe worn on the toga.
Sons of senators assumed this badge of the order by right of birth;
equestrians, by grant of the princeps. However, of the former those
who failed to qualify for the Senate were reduced to the rank of
equestrians. The possession of property valued at 1,000,000 sesterces
($50,000) was made a requirement for admission to the Senate.
</p>

<p>
The prospective senator was obliged to fill one of the minor city
magistracies known as the board of twenty (<hi rend="italic">viginti-virate</hi>), next to
serve as a legionary tribune and then, at the age of twenty-five, to
become a candidate for the quaestorship, which gave admission to
the Senate. From the quaestorship the official career of the senator
led through the regular magistracies, the aedileship or tribunate, and
the praetorship, to the consulship. As an ex-praetor and ex-consul
a senator might be appointed a promagistrate to govern a senatorial
province; a legate to command a legion or administer an imperial
province; or a curator in charge of some administrative commission
in Rome or Italy.
</p>

<p>
During the republic the Senate had been the actual center of the
administration and Augustus intended that it should continue to be
so for the greater part of the empire. Through the ordinary magistrates
it should govern Rome and Italy, and through the promagistrates
the senatorial provinces. Furthermore, the state treasury, the <hi rend="italic">aerarium
saturni</hi>, supported by the revenues from Italy and the Senate’s provinces,
remained under the authority of that body. However, to render
it capable of fulfilling its task and to reëstablish its prestige, the
Senate which now numbered over one thousand had to be purged
of many undesirable members who had been admitted to its roll during
the recent civil wars. Therefore, in 28 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Augustus in his
consular capacity supervised a revision of the senatorial list whereby
two hundred unworthy persons were excluded. On that occasion his
name was placed at the head of the new roll as the <hi rend="italic">princeps senatus</hi>.
<pb n="210"/><anchor id="Pg210"/>A second recension ten years later reduced the total membership to
six hundred. A third, in 4 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, commenced through a specially
chosen committee of three with the object of further reducing their
number was not carried out. The Senate was automatically recruited
by the annual admission of the twenty quaestors, but in addition
the princeps enjoyed the right of appointing new members who
might be entered upon the roll of the Senate among the past holders
of any magistracy. In this way many prominent equestrians were
admitted to the senatorial order.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The equestrian order.</hi> For the conduct of his share of the
public administration the princeps required a great number of assistants
in his personal employ. For his legates to command the legions
or his provinces with delegated military authority Augustus could
draw upon the senators, but both custom and the prestige of the
Senate forbade their entering his service in other capacities. On the
other hand, freedmen and slaves, who might well be employed in a
clerical position, obviously could not be made the sole civil servants
of the princeps. Therefore, Augustus drew into his service the
equestrian order whose business interests and traditional connection
with the public finances seemed to mark them out as peculiarly fitted
to be his agents in the financial administration of the provinces.
</p>

<p>
The equestrian order in general was open to all Roman citizens in
Italy and the provinces who were eighteen years of age, of free birth
and good character, and possessed a census rating of 400,000 sesterces
($20,000). Admission to the order was in the control of the princeps,
and carried the right to wear a narrow purple stripe on the toga
and to receive a public horse, the possession of which qualified an
equestrian for the imperial civil and military service. With the bestowal
of the public horse Augustus revived the long neglected annual
parade and inspection of the <hi rend="italic">equites</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Like the career of the senators, that of the equestrians included
both military and civil appointments. At the outset of his <hi rend="italic">cursus
honorum</hi> the equestrian held several military appointments, which
somewhat later came regularly to include a prefecture of a corps of
auxiliary infantry, a tribunate of a legionary cohort, and a prefecture
of an auxiliary cavalry corps. Thereupon he was eligible for a procuratorship,
that is, a post in the imperial civil service, usually in
connection with the administration of the finances. After filling several
of these procuratorships, of which there were a great number of
<pb n="211"/><anchor id="Pg211"/>varying importance, an equestrian might finally attain one of the
great prefectures, as commander of the city watch, administrator of
the corn supply of Rome, commander of the imperial guards, or governor
of Egypt. At the end of his equestrian career he might be
enrolled in the senatorial order. Thus through the imperial service
the equestrian order was bound closely to the princeps and from its
ranks there gradually developed a nobility thoroughly loyal to the
new régime.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Comitia and the plebs.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi>, which had so long
voiced the will of the sovereign Roman people was not abolished,
although it could no longer claim to speak in the name of the Roman
citizens as a whole. It still kept up the form of electing magistrates
and enacting legislation, but its action was largely determined by
the recommendations of the princeps and his tribunician authority.
</p>

<p>
While the city plebs, accustomed to receive its free distributions
of grain, and to be entertained at costly public spectacles, was a heavy
drain upon the resources of the state, the vigorous third estate in
the Italian municipalities supplied the subaltern officers of the legions.
These were the centurions, who were the mainstay of the discipline
and efficiency of the troops, and from whose ranks many advanced to
an equestrian career.

        <index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="III. The Military Establishment"/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. The Military Establishment</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Reorganization of the army.</hi> Upon his return to Italy in 30
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Augustus found himself at the head of an army of about 500,000
men. Of these he released more than 300,000 from service and settled
them in colonies or in their native municipalities upon lands
which it was his boast to have purchased and not confiscated. This
done, he proceeded to reorganize the military establishment. Accepting
the lessons of the civil wars, he maintained a permanent, professional
army, recruited as far as possible by voluntary enlistment.
This army comprised two main categories of troops, the legionaries
and the auxiliaries.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The legions and auxilia.</hi> The legionaries were recruited from
Roman citizens or from provincials who received Roman citizenship
upon their enlistment. Their units of organization, the legions, comprised
nearly 6000 men, of whom 120 were cavalry and the rest infantry.
The number of legions was at first eighteen, but was later
<pb n="212"/><anchor id="Pg212"/>raised to twenty-five, giving a total of about 150,000 men. The auxiliaries,
who took the place of the contingents of Italian allies of earlier
days, were recruited from among the most warlike subject peoples of
the empire and their numbers were approximately equal to the legionaries.
They were organized in small infantry and cavalry corps
(cohorts and <hi rend="italic">alae</hi>), each 480 or 960 strong. At the expiration of their
term of service the auxiliaries were granted the reward of Roman citizenship.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The praetorians.</hi> A third category of troops, which, although
greatly inferior in number to the legions and auxiliaries, played an
exceptionally influential rôle in the history of the principate, was
the praetorian guard. This was the imperial bodyguard which
attended Augustus in his capacity of commander-in-chief of the
Roman armies. It owed its influence to the fact that it was stationed
in the vicinity of Rome while the other troops were stationed in the
provinces. Under Augustus the praetorian guard comprised nine
cohorts, each 1000 strong, under the command of two praetorian prefects
of equestrian rank. The praetorians were recruited exclusively
from the Italian peninsula, and enjoyed a shorter term of service and
higher pay than the other corps.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Conditions of service.</hi> It was not until 6 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> that the term of
enlistment and the conditions of discharge were definitely fixed. From
that date service in the praetorian guard was for sixteen years, in
the legions for twenty and in the <hi rend="italic">auxilia</hi> for twenty-five. At their
discharge the praetorians received a bonus of 5000 denarii ($1000),
while the legionaries were given 3000 denarii ($600) in addition to
an assignment of land. The discharged legionaries were regularly
settled in colonies throughout the provinces. To meet this increased
expense Augustus was obliged to establish a military treasury (the
<hi rend="italic">aerarium militare</hi>), endowed out of his private patrimony, and supported
by the revenue derived from two newly imposed taxes, a five
per cent inheritance tax (<hi rend="italic">vincesima hereditatium</hi>) which affected all
Roman citizens, and a one per cent tax on all goods publicly sold
(<hi rend="italic">centesima rerum venalium</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The fleets.</hi> For the policing of the coast of Italy and the adjacent
seas Augustus created a permanent fleet with stations at Ravenna and
Misenum. Conforming to the comparative unimportance of the
Roman naval, in contrast to their military establishment, the personnel
of this fleet was recruited in large measure from imperial freedmen
<pb n="213"/><anchor id="Pg213"/>and slaves. Only after Augustus were these squadrons and other
similar ones in the provinces placed under equestrian prefects.
</p>

<p>
The military system of Augustus strongly emphasized and guaranteed
the supremacy of Italy and the Italians over the provincials.
Both the officers and the elite troops were drawn almost exclusively
from Italy or the latinized parts of the western provinces. In like
manner the reservation of the higher grades of the civil administration,
the second prop of Roman rule, for Roman senators and equestrians,
as well as the exclusion of the provincial imperial cult from
Italian soil, marked clearly the distinction between the conquering
and the subject races of the empire. Yet it was Augustus himself
who pointed the way to the ultimate romanization of the provincials
by the bestowal of citizenship as one of the rewards for military service
and by the settlement of colonies of veterans in the provinces.
</p>
    </div><div>
        <index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="IV. The Revival of Religion and Morality"/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">IV. The Revival of Religion and Morality</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The ideals of Augustus.</hi> A counterpart to the governmental reorganization
effected by Augustus was his attempt to revive the old
time Roman virtues which had fallen into contempt during the last
centuries of the republic. This moral regeneration of the Roman
people he regarded as the absolutely essential basis for a new era of
peace and prosperity. And the reawakening of morality was necessarily
preceded by a revival of the religious rites and ceremonies
that in recent times had passed into oblivion through the attraction of
new cults, the growth of skepticism, or the general disorder into which
the public administration had fallen as a result of civil strife.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The revival of public religion.</hi> One step in this direction was
the reëstablishment of the ancient priestly colleges devoted to the
performance of particular rites or the cult of particular <anchor id="corr213"/><corr sic="dieties">deities</corr>. To
provide these colleges with the required number of patrician members
Augustus created new patrician families. He himself was enrolled
in each of these colleges and, at the death of Lepidus in 12 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, was
elected chief pontiff, the head of the state religion. A second measure
was the repair of temples and shrines which had lapsed into decay.
The temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, those of Quirinus and the Magna
Mater, besides eighty-two other shrines of lesser fame, were repaired
or restored by him. One of his generals, Munatius Plancus, renewed
the temple of Saturn in the forum. A new temple was erected by
<pb n="214"/><anchor id="Pg214"/>Augustus to Mars the Avenger on the forum begun by Julius Caesar,
another to the deified Julius himself on the old forum, and a third on
the Palatine hill to Apollo, to whom he rendered thanks for the victory
at Actium.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Lares and the Genius Augusti.</hi> Among the divinities whose
cult was thus quickened into life were the Lares, the guardian deities
of the crossways, whose worship was especially practiced by the common
folk. Between the years 12 and 7 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> each of the two hundred
and sixty-five <hi rend="italic">vici</hi> into which the city of Rome was then divided was
provided with a shrine dedicated to the Lares and the Genius of
Augustus, that is, the divine spirit which watched over his fortunes.
This worship was conducted by a committee of masters, annually
elected by the inhabitants of these quarters. In this way the city
plebs while not worshipping the princeps himself, were yet encouraged
to look upon him as their protector and guardian.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The imperial cult.</hi> A new religion which was to be symbolic of
the unity of the empire and the loyalty of the provincials was the cult
of Rome and Augustus, commonly known as the imperial cult. The
worship of the goddess Roma, the personification of the Roman state,
had sprung up voluntarily in the cities of Greece and Asia after
197 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> when the power of Rome began to supplant the authority
of the Hellenistic monarchs for whom deification by their subjects was
the theoretical basis of their autocratic power. This voluntary worship
had also been accorded to individual Romans, as Flamininus,
Sulla, Caesar and Mark Antony. As early as 29 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the cities of
Pergamon in Asia and Nicomedia in Bithynia erected temples dedicated
to Roma and Augustus, and established quinquennial religious
festivals called <hi rend="italic">Romaia Sebasta</hi>. Other cities followed their example
and before the death of Augustus each province in the Orient had at
least one altar dedicated to Roma and the princeps. From the East
the imperial cult was officially transplanted to the West.
</p>

<p>
In the year 12 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> an altar of Rome and Augustus was established
at the junction of the rivers Rhone and Sâone, opposite the
town of Lugdunum (modern Lyons), the administrative center of
Transalpine Gaul apart from the Narbonese province. Here the peoples
of Gaul were to unite in the outward manifestation of their
loyalty to Roman rule. A similar altar was erected at what is now
Cologne in the land of the Ubii between 9 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> and 9 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Both in
the East and in the West the maintenance of the imperial cult was
<pb n="215"/><anchor id="Pg215"/>imposed upon provincial councils, composed of representatives of the
municipal or tribal units in which each province was divided.
</p>

<p>
The imperial cult in the provinces was thus the expression of the
absolute authority of Rome and Augustus over the subjects of Rome,
but for that very reason Augustus could not admit its development on
Italian soil; for to do so would be to deny his claim to be a Roman
magistrate, deriving his authority from the Roman people, among
whom he was the chief citizen, and would stamp his government as
monarchical and autocratic. Therefore, although the poet Horace,
voicing the public sentiment, in 27 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> acclaimed him as the new
Mercury, and both municipalities and individuals in southern Italy
spontaneously established his worship, this movement received no
official encouragement and never became important. However, from
the year 12 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> onwards, there were established religious colleges of
<hi rend="italic">Augustales</hi>, or priestly officers called <hi rend="italic">Sevìri Augustales</hi>, in many
Italian municipalities for the celebration of the cult of Augustus either
alone or in conjunction with some other divinity such as Mercury
or Hercules. As these Augustales were almost exclusively drawn
from the class of <anchor id="corr215"/><corr sic="freedom">freedmen</corr> who were no longer admitted to full Roman
citizenship, Augustus avoided receiving worship from the latter, while
assuring himself of the loyalty of the <hi rend="italic">liberti</hi> and gratifying their pride
by encouraging a municipal office to which they were eligible.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The leges Juliae and the lex Papia Poppaea.</hi> However, Augustus
was not content to trust solely to the moral effects of religious
exercises and resorted to legislative action to check the degenerate
tendencies of his age. The Julian laws of 19 and 18 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> aimed at
the restoration of the soundness of family life, the encouragement of
marriage, and the discouragement of childlessness, by placing disabilities
upon unmarried and childless persons. These measures provoked
great opposition, but Augustus was in earnest and supplemented
his earlier laws by the <hi rend="italic">lex Papia Poppaea</hi> of 9 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> which gave precedence
to fathers over less fortunate persons among the candidates for
public office. A commentary on the effectiveness of his earlier laws
was the fact that both the consuls who sponsored this later one were
themselves unmarried. To prevent the Italian element among the
citizens from being swamped by a continuous influx of liberated
slaves, Augustus placed restrictions upon the right of manumission
and refused freedmen the public rights of Roman citizens, although
granting these to their sons. By example as well as by precept he
<pb n="216"/><anchor id="Pg216"/>sought to hold in check the luxurious tendencies of the age, and in his
own household to furnish a model of ancient Roman simplicity.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Secular Games, 17 B. C.</hi> To publicly inaugurate the new
era in the life of the state begun under his auspices, Augustus celebrated
the festival of the Secular Games in the year 17 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, for which
Horace wrote the inaugural ode, his <hi rend="italic">Carmen Saeculare</hi>.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Dyarchy.</hi> The division of the provinces between Augustus
and the Senate in 27 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> had the effect of creating an administrative
dyarchy, or joint rule of two independent authorities, for the empire.
However, the original allotment of the provinces underwent some
modification subsequent to 27 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> In 23 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Augustus transferred
to the Senate Narbonese Gaul where the rapid progress of colonization
had made it <q>more a part of Italy than a province.</q> In exchange
he took over Illyricum, where the progress of the Roman arms
had been interrupted by the outbreak of the war with Antony and
where the Romans were confronted by warlike and restless peoples of
the hinterland. Somewhat later Cilicia also became an imperial
province and in 6 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Sardinia was placed under an imperial procurator
because of disturbances on the island. Southern Greece, previously
dependent upon the province of Macedon, was placed under
the government of the Senate as the province of Achaea. New administrative
districts organized by Augustus out of territories conquered
by his generals remained under his control.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Survey and census of the empire.</hi> The main expense of the
military and civil establishment of the empire was defrayed by the
revenues from the provinces. As a basis for an accurate estimate of
their resources for purposes of taxation and recruitment Augustus
caused a comprehensive census of the population and an evaluation
of property to be taken in each newly organized district, and provided
for a systematic revision of the census in all the imperial provinces.
In addition a general chart of the empire was compiled on the basis
of an extended survey conducted under the direction of Agrippa.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The foreign policy of Augustus.</hi> As we have seen, Augustus
since he was commander-in-chief of the Roman armies and in charge
of the administration of the most important border provinces, was entrusted
by the senate with the direction of the foreign relations of the
<pb n="217"/><anchor id="Pg217"/>state. Here his aims conformed to the general conservatism of his
policies and were directed towards securing a defensible frontier for
the empire which should protect the peace that he had established
within its borders. His military operations were conducted with due
regard to the man power and the financial resources of the state. To
secure the defensible frontier at which he aimed it was necessary for
Augustus to incorporate in the empire a number of border peoples
whose independence was a menace to the peace of the provinces and
to establish some client kingdoms as buffer states between Roman territory
and otherwise dangerous neighbors.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The settlement in Spain.</hi> The northwestern corner of the Spanish
peninsula was still occupied by independent peoples, the Cantabri,
Astures and the Callaeci, who <anchor id="corr217"/><corr sic="harrassed">harassed</corr> with their forays the pacified
inhabitants of the Roman provinces. To secure peace in this quarter
Augustus determined upon the complete subjugation of these peoples.
From 27 to 24 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> he was present in Spain and between these years
his lieutenants Antistius, Carisius and Agrippa conducted campaigns
against them in their mountain fastness, and, overcoming their desperate
resistance, settled them in the valleys and secured their territory
by founding colonies of veterans. A subsequent revolt in 20–19
was crushed by Marcus Agrippa.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The pacification of the Alps, 25–8 B. C.</hi> A similar problem was
presented by the Alpine peoples, who not only made devastating raids
into northern Italy but also in the west occupied the passes which
offered the most direct routes between Italy and Transalpine Gaul.
In 26 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> occurred a revolt of the Salassi, in the neighborhood of
the Little St. Bernard, who had been subdued eight years before.
In the following year they were completely subjugated, and those who
escaped slaughter were sold into slavery. In 16 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the district of
Noricum, i. e., modern Tyrol and Salzburg, was occupied by Publius
Silius Nerva, in consequence of a raid of the Noricans into the Istrian
peninsula. In 15 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, the step-son of Augustus, Nero Claudius
Drusus, crossed the Brenner Pass and forced his way over the Vorarlberg
range to Lake Constance, subduing the Raeti on his way. On
the shores of Lake Constance he met his elder brother, Tiberius Claudius
Nero, who had marched eastwards from Gaul. Together they
defeated and subjugated the Vindelici. On the north the Danube
was now the Roman frontier. A number of isolated campaigns
completed the subjugation of the remaining Alpine peoples by 8
<pb n="218"/><anchor id="Pg218"/><hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Raetia and Noricum were organized as procuratorial provinces,
while the smaller Alpine districts were placed under imperial
prefects.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Gaul and Germany.</hi> Caesar had left the land of Gallia Comata
crushed but still unsettled and not fully incorporated in the empire.
It fell to the lot of Augustus to complete its organization, which was
accomplished between 27 and 13 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Subsequent to the transfer of
the Narbonese province to the Senate <hi rend="italic">Gallia comata</hi> was divided into
three districts; Aquitania, Lugdunensis and Belgica, which, however,
during the lifetime of Augustus, formed an administrative unity,
under one governor with subordinate <hi rend="italic">legati</hi> in each district. The
colony of Lugdunum was the seat of the administration, as well as of
the imperial cult. No attempt was made to latinize the three Gauls
by the founding of Roman colonies; but they remained divided into
sixty-four separate peoples, called <hi rend="italic">civitates</hi>, with a tribal organization
under the control of a native nobility. As early as 27 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> Augustus
took a census in Gaul, and on this basis fixed its tax obligations.
The rich lands of Gaul were as important a source of imperial revenue
as its vigorous population was of recruits for the Roman auxiliary
forces.
</p>

<p>
But the Gauls were restive under their new burdens and were in
addition liable to be stirred up by the Germanic tribes who came from
across the Rhine. An invading horde of Sugambri in 16 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> defeated
a Roman army and, upon a renewed inroad by the same people
in 12 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Augustus determined to cross the Rhine and secure the
frontier of Gaul by the subjugation of the Germans to the north.
The Germans, like the Gauls at the time of the Roman conquest, were
divided into a number of independent tribes usually at enmity with
one another and hence incapable of forming a lasting combination
against a common foe. Individually they were powerful and courageous,
but their military efficiency was impaired by their lack of
unity and discipline.
</p>

<p>
Drusus, conqueror of the Raeti, was appointed to command the
Roman army of invasion. He first secured the Rhine frontier by the
construction of a line of fortresses stretching from Vindonissa (near
Basle) to Castra Vetera (near Xanten), the latter of which, with
Mogontiacum (Mainz) were his chief bases. Then, crossing the
river, in four campaigns (12–9 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>) he overran and subjugated the
territory between the Rhine and the Elbe. His operations were greatly
<pb n="219"/><anchor id="Pg219"/>aided by his fleet, for which he constructed a canal from the Rhine
to the Zuider Zee, and which facilitated the conquest of the coast
peoples, among them the Batavi, who became firm Roman allies. On
the return march from the Elbe in 9 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Drusus was fatally injured
by a fall from his horse. His brother Tiberius succeeded him in command
and strengthened the Roman hold on the transrhenene conquests.
Drusus was buried in Rome, whither Tiberius escorted his
corpse on foot, and was honored with the name Germanicus.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Illyricum and Thrace.</hi> To the east of the Adriatic the Roman
provinces of Illyricum and Macedonia were subject to constant incursions
of the Pannonians, Getae (or Dacians) and Bastarnae, peoples
settled in the middle and lower Danube valley. Marcus Licinius
Crassus, Governor of Macedonia, in 30 and 29 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> defeated the
Getae and Bastarnae, crossed the Balkans, carried the Roman arms
to the Danube and subdued the Moesi to the south of that river.
However, it required a considerable time before the various Thracian
tribes were finally subdued and a client kingdom under the Thracian
prince Cotys was interposed between Macedonia and the lower Danube.
Meantime, the Pannonians had been conquered in a number
of hard fought campaigns which were brought to a successful conclusion
by Tiberius (12–9 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>) who made the Drave the Roman
boundary. The contemporaneous conquest of Pannonia and of Germany
between the Rhine and the Elbe was one of the greatest feats of
Roman arms and reveals the army of the empire at the height of its
discipline and organization. In 13 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, during a lull in these frontier
struggles, the Senate voted the erection of an altar to the peace of
Augustus (the <hi rend="italic">ara pacis Augustae</hi>), in grateful recognition of his
maintenance of peace within the empire.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The revolt of Illyricum and Germany.</hi> For several years following
the death of Drusus no further conquests were attempted until 4
<hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, when Tiberius was again appointed to command the army of
the Rhine. After assuring himself of the allegiance of the Germans
by a demonstration as far as the Elbe and by the establishment of
fortified posts, he prepared to complete the northern boundary by the
conquest of the kingdom of the Marcomanni, in modern Bohemia,
between the Elbe and the Danube. In 6 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Tiberius was on the
point of advancing northward from the Danube, in coöperation with
Gaius Saturninus, who was to move eastwards from the Rhine, when
a revolt broke out in Illyricum which forced the abandonment of the
<pb n="220"/><anchor id="Pg220"/>undertaking and the conclusion of peace with Marbod, the king of
the Marcomanni. The revolt, in which both Pannonians and Dalmatians
joined, was caused by the severity of the Roman exactions,
especially the levies for the army. For a moment Italy trembled in
fear of an invasion; in the raising of new legions even freedmen were
called into service. But the arrival of reinforcements from other
provinces enabled Tiberius after three years of ruthless warfare to
utterly crush the desperate resistance of the rebels (9 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). The
organization of Pannonia as a separate province followed the reëstablishment
of peace.
</p>

<p>
Until the last year of the war in Illyricum the Germanic tribes had
remained quiet under Roman overlordship. But in 9 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, provoked
by the attempt of the new Roman commander, Publius Quinctilius
Varus, to subject them to stricter control, they united to free themselves
from foreign rule. In the coalition the Cherusci and Chatti
were the chief peoples, and Arminius, a young chieftain of the
Cherusci, was its leading spirit. Varus and his army of three legions
were surprised on the march in the Teutoberg Forest and completely
annihilated. Rome was in panic over the news, but the Germans did
not follow up their initial success. Tiberius was again sent to the
post of danger and vindicated the honor of Rome by two successful
expeditions across the Rhine. But no attempt was made to recover
permanently the lost ground. The frontier of the Elbe was given up
for that of the Rhine with momentous consequences for the future of
the empire and of Europe. The coast peoples, however, remained
Roman allies and a narrow strip of territory was held on the right
bank of the Rhine. The reason lay in the weakness of the Roman
military organization, caused by the strain of the Illyrian revolt and
the difficulty of finding recruits for the Roman legions among the
Italians. The cry of Augustus, <q>Quinctilius Varus, give back my
legions,</q> gives the clue to his abandonment of Germany.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The eastern frontier.</hi> In the East alone was Rome confronted
by a power which was in any way a match for her military strength
and which had disastrously defeated two Roman invasions. The
conquest of this, the Parthian kingdom, appeared to Augustus to
offer no compensation comparable to the exertions it would entail and
therefore he determined to rest content with such a reassertion of
Roman supremacy in the Near East as would wipe out the shame of
the defeats of Crassus and Antony and guarantee Roman territory
<pb n="221"/><anchor id="Pg221"/>from Parthian attack. He was prepared to accept the natural frontier
of the Euphrates as the eastern boundary of Roman territory.
Between the Roman provinces in Asia Minor and the upper Euphrates
lay a number of client kingdoms, Galatia, Pontus, Cappadocia and
Lesser Armenia, and Commagene. At the death of Amyntas, king
of Galatia, in 25 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, his kingdom was made into a province, but
the others were left under their native dynasts. Across the Euphrates
lay Armenia, a buffer state between the Roman possessions and Parthia,
which was of strategic importance because it commanded the
military routes between Asia Minor and the heart of the Parthian
country. To establish a protectorate over Armenia was therefore the
ambition of both Rome and Parthia. During the presence of Augustus
in the East (22–19 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>), Tiberius placed a Roman nominee on
the Armenian throne, and received from the Parthian king, Phraates
IV, the Roman standards and captives in Parthian hands, a success
which earned Augustus the salutation of <hi rend="italic">imperator</hi> from his troops.
Later Phraates sent four of his sons as hostages to Rome. But the
Roman protectorate over Armenia was by no means permanent; its
supporters had soon to give way to the Parthian party. Gaius Caesar
between 1 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> and 2 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> restored Roman influence, but again the
Parthians got the upper hand and held it until 9 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, when Phraates
was overthrown and was succeeded by one of his sons whom Augustus
sent from Rome at the request of the Parthians.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Judaea and Arabia.</hi> To the south of the Roman province of
Syria lay the kingdom of Judaea, ruled by Herod until his death in
4 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, when it was divided among his sons. Subsequently Judaea
proper was made a province administered by a Roman procurator.
To the east of the Dead Sea was the kingdom of the Nabataean
Arabs, who controlled the caravan routes of the Arabian peninsula
and who were firm Roman allies. With their aid a Roman army
under Aelius Gallus in 25 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> sought to penetrate into the rich spice
land of Arabia Felix, but suffered such losses in its march across
the desert that it was forced to return without effecting a conquest.
At the same time Gaius Petronius defeated the Ethiopians under
Queen Candace and secured the southern frontier of Egypt. Through
the ports of Egypt on the Red Sea a brisk trade developed with India,
from which distant land embassies on various occasions came to
Augustus. Further west in Africa, Augustus added the kingdom of
Numidia to the province of Africa, and transferred its ruler, Juba II,
<pb n="222"/><anchor id="Pg222"/>whose wife was Cleopatra, daughter of Antony the triumvir, to the
kingdom of Mauretania (25 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
The conquests of Augustus established in their essential features the
future boundaries of the Roman Empire. At his death he left it as a
maxim of state for his successor to abstain from further expansion.
</p>

        <index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="VI. The Administration of Rome"/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">VI. The Administration of Rome</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The problem of police.</hi> One of the great problems which had
confronted the Roman government from the time of the Gracchi was
the policing of Rome and the suppression of mob violence. To a certain
extent the establishment of the praetorian guard served to overawe
the city mob, although only three of its cohorts were at first stationed
in the city. As a supplement to the praetorians Augustus
organized three urban cohorts, each originally 1500 strong, who
ranked between the legionaries and praetorians. Between 12 and
7 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the city was divided for administrative purposes into fourteen
regions, subdivided into 265 <hi rend="italic">vici</hi> or wards. Each region was put
in charge of a tribune or aedile. A force of six hundred slaves under
the two curule aediles was formed as a fire brigade. But as these
proved ineffective in 6 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Augustus created a corps of <hi rend="italic">vigiles</hi> to
serve as a fire brigade and night watch. This corps consisted of
seven cohorts, one for every two regions, and was under the command
of an equestrian prefect of the watch (<hi rend="italic">praefectus vigilum</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Annona.</hi> Another vital problem was the provision of an adequate
supply of grain for the city. A famine in 22 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> produced
so serious a situation that the Senate was forced to call upon Augustus
to assume the responsibility for this branch of the administration.
At first he tried to meet the situation through the appointment of
curators of senatorial rank, but after 6 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> he created the office of
prefect of the grain supply, filled by an equestrian appointee of the
princeps. His duty was to see that there was an adequate supply of
grain on hand for the market at a reasonable price and in addition
to make the monthly distribution of free grain to the city plebs. The
number of recipients of this benefit was fixed at 200,000.
</p>

<p>
In this way Augustus was forced to take over one of the spheres
of the government which he had intended should remain under the
direction of the Senate and to witness himself the first step towards the
breakdown of the administrative dyarchy which he had created.
</p>

    <index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="VII. The Problem of the Succession"/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">VII. The Problem of the Succession</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The policy of Augustus.</hi> In theory the position of the princeps
was that of a magistrate who derived his powers from the Senate and
the Roman people, and hence the choice of his successor legally lay
in their hands. However, Augustus realized that to leave the field
open to rival candidates would inevitably lead to a recrudescence of
civil war. Therefore he determined to designate his own successor
and to make the latter’s appointment a matter beyond dispute. Furthermore,
his own career as the son and heir of Julius Caesar warned
him that this heir to the principate must be found within his own
household, and his precarious health was a constant reminder that
he could not await the approach of old age before settling this problem.
And so, from the early years of his office, he arranged the
matrimonial alliances of his kinsfolk in the interests of the state
without regard to their personal preferences, to the end that in the
event of his decease there would be a member of the Julian house
prepared to assume his laborious task. Yet the unexpected length of
his life caused Augustus to outlive many of those whom he from
time to time looked upon as the heirs to his position in the state.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Marcus Marcellus and Agrippa.</hi> Augustus had one daughter
Julia, by his second wife Scribonia. He had no sons, but Livia
Drusilla, whom he took as his third wife in 36 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, brought him
two stepsons, Tiberius and Drusus. Yet not one of these but his
nephew, Marcus Marcellus, was his first choice for a successor.
Marcellus received Julia as his wife in 25 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, the next year at the
age of nineteen he was admitted to the Senate, and in 23 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, as
aedile, he won the favor of the populace by his magnificent public
shows. When Marcellus died in 23 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, Augustus turned to his
loyal adherent Agrippa, to whom Julia was now wedded. In 18 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
Agrippa received proconsular <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">tribunicia potestas</hi> for
five years, powers that were reconferred with those of Augustus in
13 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Tiberius.</hi> But in the next year Agrippa died, and Augustus, regarding
his eldest stepson Tiberius, the conqueror of Noricum, as the
one best qualified to succeed himself, forced him to divorce the wife
to whom he was devoted and to marry Julia. At that time he was
given the important Illyrian command and in 6 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the tribunician
authority was granted him for a five year term. But Tiberius,
recog<pb n="224"/><anchor id="Pg224"/>nizing that he was soon to be set aside for the two elder sons of
Agrippa and Julia, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, whom Augustus had
adopted and taken into his own house, and being disgusted with the
flagrant unfaithfulness of Julia, retired into private life at Rhodes,
thereby incurring the deep enmity of his stepfather.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Gaius and Lucius Caesar.</hi> Gaius and Lucius Caesar assumed
the garb of manhood (the <hi rend="italic">toga virilis</hi>) at the age of fifteen in 5 and
2 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, respectively. To celebrate each occasion Augustus held the
consulship, and placed them at the head of the equestrian order with
the title <hi rend="italic">principes iuventutis</hi>. They were exempted from the limitations
of the <hi rend="italic">cursus honorum</hi> so that each might hold the consulate in
his twentieth year. In 1 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Gaius was sent to the East with proconsular
imperium to settle fresh trouble in Armenia. There in the
siege of a petty fortress he received a wound from which he died in
4 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Two years previously Lucius had fallen a victim to fever
while on his way to Spain. In the meantime Augustus had experienced
another blow in his discovery of the scandalous conduct of
Julia. Her guilt was the more unpardonable in view of the efforts
of her father to restore the moral tone of society. She was banished
to the island rock of Pandataria, her companions in crime were punished,
the most with banishment, one with death on a charge of treason
(1 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>). Her elder daughter, also called Julia, later met the
same fate for a like offence.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Tiberius.</hi> At the death of Gaius Caesar, Augustus turned once
more to Tiberius, who had been permitted to leave Rhodes at the
intercession of Livia. In 4 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> he was adopted by Augustus and
received the <hi rend="italic">tribunicia potestas</hi> for ten years. In 13 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> his tribunician
power was renewed and he was made the colleague of Augustus
in the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>. Tiberius himself had been obliged to adopt his
nephew Germanicus, the son of Drusus, who married Agrippina, the
younger daughter of Agrippa and Julia. Association in authority
and adoption where necessary had become the means of designating
the successor in the principate.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">VIII. Augustus as a Statesman</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The death of Augustus.</hi> In 14 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Augustus held a census of
the Roman citizens in the empire. They numbered 4,937,000, an
increase of 826,000 since 28 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> In the same year he set up in
<pb n="225"/><anchor id="Pg225"/>Rome an inscription recording his exploits and the sums which he had
expended in the interests of the state. A copy of this has been found
inscribed on the walls of the temple of Roma and Augustus at Ancyra,
and hence is known as the Monument of Ancyra. On 19 August,
14 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, Augustus died at Nola in Campania, at the age of seventy-six.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">An estimate of his statesmanship.</hi> Opinions have differed and
probably always will differ upon the question whether or not Augustus
sought to establish a disguised form of monarchical government.
Still, in his favor stands the fact that, although when a young man
confronted or allied with rivals who sought his destruction he seized
power by illegal means, after the fate of the state was in his hands
and he had reëstablished an orderly form of government, he conscientiously
restricted himself to the use of the powers which were
legally conferred upon him. So ably did he conciliate public opinion
that the few conspiracies formed against his life and power had no
serious backing and constituted no real danger to himself or his
system. To have effected so important a change in the constitution
with so little friction is proof of a statesmanship of a high order.
</p>

<p>
His principate marks the beginning of a new epoch in Roman history
and determined the course of the subsequent political development
of the empire. And the system he inaugurated finds its greatest
justification in the era of the <hi rend="italic">pax Romana</hi> which it ushered in.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The weakness of his system.</hi> Yet it must be admitted that this
system contained two innate weaknesses. Firstly, it was built up
around the personality of Augustus, who could trust himself not to
abuse his great power, and secondly, the princeps, as commander-in-chief
of the Roman army, was immeasurably more powerful than the
second partner in the administration, the Senate, and able to assert
his will against all opposition. Now, as has well been observed, the
working of the principate depended upon the coöperation of the
Senate and the self-restraint of the emperors, consequently, when the
former proved incapable and the latter abused their power, the inevitable
consequence was an autocracy. That Augustus realized this
himself towards the end of his life is highly probable, yet as the one
who brought order out of chaos and gave peace to an exhausted world
his name will always be one of the greatest in the history of Rome or
indeed of the human race.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Tiberius princeps.</hi> At the death of Augustus, Tiberius by right
of his <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> assumed command of the army and through his tribunician
authority convoked the Senate to pay the last honors to Augustus
and decide upon his successor. Like Julius Caesar, Augustus was
deified, and a priestly college of Augustales, chosen from the senatorial
order was founded to maintain his worship in Rome. In accordance
with a wish expressed in his will, his widow Livia was
honored with the name Augusta. Tiberius received the title of Augustus
and the other honors and powers which his predecessor had
made the prerogatives of the princeps. His <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>, however, was
conferred for life, and not for a limited period. The ease of his
succession shows how solidly the principate was established at the
death of its founder.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Character and policy.</hi> Tiberius was now fifty-six years of age.
He had spent the greater part of his life in the public service, and
consequently had a full appreciation of the burden of responsibility
which the princeps must assume. He was the incarnation of the old
Roman sense of duty to the state, and at the same time exhibited the
proud reserve of the Roman patricians. Stern in his maintenance of
law and order, he made an excellent subordinate, but when called
upon to guide the policy of state, he displayed hesitation and lack
of decision. The incidents of his marriage with Julia and his exile
had rendered him bitter and suspicious, and he utterly lacked the
personal charm and adaptability of his predecessor. Thus he was
temperamentally unsuited to the position he was called upon to fill
and this was responsible for his frequent misunderstandings with the
Senate. Such an incident occurred in the meetings of the Senate
after the death of Augustus. Tiberius, conscious of his
unpopu<pb n="227"/><anchor id="Pg227"/>larity, sought to have the Senate press upon him the appointment as
the successor of Augustus, and so feigned reluctance to accept, a
course which made the senators suspect that he was laying a trap for
possible rivals. Yet there was no princeps who tried more conscientiously
to govern in the spirit of Augustus, or upheld more rigidly
the rights and dignity of the Senate. At the beginning of his principate
he transferred from the Assembly to the Senate the right of the
election to the magistracies, thus relieving the senators from the expense
and annoyance of canvassing the populace.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Mutinies in Illyricum and on the Rhine.</hi> Two serious mutinies
followed the accession of Tiberius, one in the army stationed in
Illyricum, the other among the legions on the Rhine. Failure to
discharge those who had completed their terms of service and the
severity of the service itself were the grounds of dissatisfaction. The
Illyrian mutiny was quelled by the praetorian prefect Lucius Aelius
Seianus; the army of the Rhine was brought back to its allegiance by
Germanicus, the son of Drusus, whom Tiberius had adopted at the
command of Augustus in 4 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> He had married Agrippina, daughter
of Agrippa and Julia, and was looked upon as the heir of Tiberius
in preference to the latter’s younger and less able son, Drusus.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The campaigns of Germanicus, 14–17 A. D.</hi> To restore discipline
among his troops and relieve them from the monotony of camp
life, as well as to emulate the achievements of his father, Germanicus,
without the authorization of Tiberius, led his army across the Rhine.
The German tribes were still united in the coalition formed in the
time of Varus, and, under their leaders Arminius and Inguiomerus,
offered vigorous opposition to the Roman invasion. Nevertheless, in
three successive campaigns (14–16 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), Germanicus ravaged the
territory between the Rhine and the Weser and inflicted several defeats
upon the Germans. Still Arminius and his allies were by no
means subdued, and the Romans had sustained heavy losses. One
army had narrowly escaped the fate of the legions of Varus, and twice
had the transports of Germanicus suffered through storms in the
North Sea. For these reasons Tiberius forbade the prolongation of
the war and recalled Germanicus. With his departure, each of the
three Gauls was made an independent province, and two new administrative
districts called Upper and Lower Germany, under legates of
consular rank, were created on the left bank of the Rhine. Freed
from the danger of Roman interference, the Germanic tribes led by
<pb n="228"/><anchor id="Pg228"/>Arminius now engaged in a bitter struggle with Marbod, king of the
    <anchor id="corr228"/><corr sic="Marcomani">Marcomanni</corr>, which ultimately led to the overthrow of the latter’s kingdom.
Not long afterwards Arminius himself fell a victim to the
jealousy of his fellow tribesmen (19 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Eastern mission and death of Germanicus, 17–19 A. D.</hi> After
his return from Gaul, Germanicus was sent by Tiberius to settle
affairs in the East, where the Armenian question had again become
acute. While he was in Syria, a bitter quarrel developed between
himself and Piso, the legate of the province. Accordingly, when Germanicus
fell ill and died there, many accused Piso of having poisoned
him. Although the accusation was false Piso was called to Rome to
stand his trial on that charge, and, finding that the popularity of
Germanicus had biased popular opinion against him, and that Tiberius
refused him his protection because of his attempt to assert his
rights by armed force, he committed suicide. Agrippina, the ambitious
wife of Germanicus, believed that Tiberius from motives of
jealousy had been responsible for her husband’s death. She openly
displayed her hostility to the princeps, and by plotting to secure the
succession for her own children, helped to bring about their ruin
and her own.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The withdrawal of Tiberius from Rome, 26 A. D.</hi> The decision
of Tiberius to leave Rome in 26 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> and take up his residence on
the island of Capri had important consequences. One was that the
office of city prefect, who was the representative of the princeps, became
permanent. It was filled by a senator of consular rank who
commanded the urban cohorts and had wide judicial functions.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The plot of Seianus.</hi> In the second place the absence of Tiberius
gave his able and ambitious praetorian prefect Aelius Seianus encouragement
and opportunity to perfect the plot he had formed to
seize the principate for himself. He it was who concentrated the
praetorian guard, <anchor id="corr228a"/><corr sic="now,">now</corr> 10,000 strong, in their camp on the edge of
the city, and paved the way for their baneful influence upon the future
history of the principate. Having caused the death of Drusus, the
son of Tiberius, by poison, in 23 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, he intrigued to remove from
his path the sons of Germanicus, Drusus and Nero. They and their
mother Agrippina were condemned to imprisonment or exile on
charges of treason. In 31 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Seianus attained the consulate and
received proconsular <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> in the provinces. He allied himself
with the Julian house by his betrothal to Julia, the grand-daughter of
<pb n="229"/><anchor id="Pg229"/>Tiberius. But in the same year the princeps became aware of his
plans. Tiberius acted with energy. Seianus and many of his supporters
were arrested and executed.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The last years of Tiberius.</hi> The discovery of Seianus’ treachery
seems to have affected the reason of the aging princeps. His fear of
treachery became an obsession. The law of treason (<hi rend="italic">lex de maiestate</hi>)
was rigorously enforced and many persons were condemned to death,
among them Agrippina and her sons. The senators lived in terror of
being accused by informers (<hi rend="italic">delatores</hi>), and in their anxiety to conciliate
the princeps they were only too ready to condemn any of their
own number.
</p>

<p>
The memory of his later years caused Tiberius to pass down in the
traditions of the senatorial order, represented by Tacitus and Suetonius,
as a ruthless tyrant, and to obscure his real services as a conscientious
and economical administrator. His parsimony in expenditures of
the public money won him unpopularity with the city mob, but was a
blessing to the provincials to whose welfare Tiberius directed particular
attention, while he vigorously protected them against the oppression
of imperial officials. During his rule the peace of the empire
was disturbed only by a brief rising in Gaul (21 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>) and a rather
prolonged struggle with Tacfarinas, a rebellious Berber chieftain, in
Numidia (17–24 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. Caius Caligula, 37–41 a. d.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Accession.</hi> Tiberius left as his heirs his adoptive grandson Caius,
the sole surviving son of Germanicus, better known by his childhood
name of Caligula, acquired in the camps on the Rhine, and his
grandson by birth, Tiberius Gemellus. Upon Caius, the elder of
the two, then twenty-five years of age, the Senate immediately conferred
the powers of the principate. The resentment of the senators
towards his predecessor found vent in refusing him the posthumous
honor of deification. Caius adopted his cousin, but within a year
had him put to death.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Early months of his rule.</hi> The early months of his rule seemed
the dawn of a new era. The pardoning of political offenders, the
banishment of informers, the reduction of taxes, coupled with lavishness
in public entertainments and donations, all made Gaius popular
with the Senate, the army and the city plebs. However, he was a
<pb n="230"/><anchor id="Pg230"/>weakling in body and in mind, and a serious illness, brought on by
his excesses, seems to have left him mentally deranged.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Absolutism his ideal.</hi> Reared in the house of Antonia, daughter
of Antony and Octavia, in company with eastern princes of the stamp
of Herod Agrippa, he naturally came to look upon the principate as
an autocracy of the Hellenistic type. In his attempt to carry this
conception into effect, the vein of madness in his character led him
to ridiculous extremes. Not content with claiming deification for
himself and his sisters, he built a lofty bridge connecting the Palatine
Hill with the Capitoline, so that he might communicate with
Jupiter, his brother god. He prescribed the sacrifices to be offered
to himself, and was accused of seeking to imitate the Ptolemaic custom
of sister marriage. Thoroughly consistent with absolutism was
his scorn of republican magistracies and disregard of the rights of
the Senate; likewise his attempt to have himself saluted as <hi rend="italic">dominus</hi>
or <q>lord.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The conflict with the Jews.</hi> His demand for the acknowledgment
of his deification by all inhabitants of the empire brought Caius
into conflict with the Jews, who had been exempted from this formal
expression of loyalty. In Alexandria there was a large Jewish colony,
which enjoyed exceptional privileges and was consequently hated
by the other Alexandrians. Their refusal to worship the images of
Caius furnished the mob with a pretext for sacking the Jewish quarters
and forcibly installing statues of the princeps in some of their
synagogues. The Jews sent a delegation to plead their case before
Caius but could obtain no redress. In the meantime Caius had ordered
Petronius, the legate of Syria, to set up his statue in the temple
at Jerusalem, by force, if need be. However, the prudent Petronius,
seeing that this would bring about a national revolt among the Jews
delayed obeying the order, and the death of Caius relieved him of the
necessity of executing it at all.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Tyranny.</hi> In less than a year the reckless extravagance of Caius
had exhausted the immense surplus Tiberius had left in the treasury.
To secure new funds he resorted to openly tyrannical measures, extraordinary
taxes, judicial murders, confiscations, and forced legacies.
By these means money was extorted not only from Romans of all
classes but provincials also. Ptolemy, king of Mauretania, was executed
for the sake of his treasure and his kingdom made a province.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Assassination.</hi> Caius contemplated invasions of Germany and of
<pb n="231"/><anchor id="Pg231"/>Britain, but the former ended with a military parade across the
Rhine and the latter with a march to the shores of the Straits of
Dover. The fear awakened by his rule of capricious violence soon
resulted in conspiracies against his life. In January, 41 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, he
was assassinated by a tribune of the imperial guards.
</p>
    </div><div>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. Claudius, 41–54 a. d.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Nominated by the Praetorians.</hi> In the choice of a successor to
Caius the power of the praetorian guard was first clearly demonstrated.
Caius was the last male representative of the Julian <hi rend="italic">gens</hi>, and at his
death the Senate debated the question of restoring the republic.
However, the decision was made for them by the praetorians, who
dragged from his hiding place and saluted as Imperator the surviving
brother of Germanicus, Tiberius Claudius Germanicus. The Senate
had to acquiesce in his nomination and grant him the powers of the
princeps.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Character.</hi> Claudius was already fifty-one years old, but because
of his ungainly figure and limited mentality had never been seriously
considered for the principate. He was learned and pedantic, but
lacking in energy and resolution. His greatest weakness was that he
was completely under the influence of his wives, of whom he had in
succession four, and his favorite freedmen.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Policy.</hi> In general the policy of Claudius followed that of Augustus
and Tiberius. But in 47 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> he assumed the censorship for
five years, an office which Augustus had avoided because it set its
holder directly above the Senate.
</p>

<p>
In the capacity of censor, Claudius extended to the Gallic Aedui
the <hi rend="italic">jus honorum</hi> and consequently the right of admission to the Senate.
This was in accord with his policy of generously granting citizenship
to the provincials. The census taken in 47 and 48 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> showed
approximately six million Romans, nearly a million more than in the
time of Augustus. Claudius also renewed the attempt of Julius
Caesar to occupy the island of Britain. In 43 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> his legates Aulus
    <anchor id="corr231"/><corr sic="Plautius">Plautius,</corr> Vespasian and Ostorius Scapula subdued the island as far
as the Thames, and in the following years extended their conquests
farther northward. The southern part of the island became the
province of Britain. In 46 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, Thrace was incorporated as a
province at the death of its client prince.
</p>

<pb n="232"/><anchor id="Pg232"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Influence of freedmen.</hi> During the rule of Claudius the real
heads of the administration were a group of able freedmen, Narcissus,
Pallas, Polybius and, later, Callistus. While it is true that they
abused their power to amass riches for themselves, they contributed
a great deal to the organization of the imperial bureaucracy. Their
influence caused the widespread employment of imperial freedmen in
procuratorial positions.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Agrippina the younger.</hi> In 49 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> the plot of Messalina, the
third wife of Claudius, and her lover Gaius Silius, to depose the
princeps in favor of Silius, endangered the power of the trio Pallas,
Narcissus and Callistus. It was Narcissus who revealed the conspiracy
to Claudius, secured his order for the execution of Messalina,
and saw that it was carried into effect. But it was Pallas who induced
the princeps to take as his fourth wife his own niece Agrippina,
whose ambitions were to prove his ruin.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Death of Claudius.</hi> By Messalina Claudius had a son Britannicus
and a daughter Octavia, but Agrippina determined to secure the
succession for Domitius, her son by her previous husband Lucius
Domitius Ahenobarbus. In 50 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, Domitius was adopted by Claudius
as Nero Claudius Caesar. The following year he received the
<hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>, and was thus openly designated as the future princeps.
In 53 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Nero was married to Octavia and a year later Claudius
died, poisoned, as all believed, by Agrippina, who feared that further
delay would endanger her plans.
</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">IV. Nero, 54–68 a. d.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The quinquennium Neronis.</hi> Agrippina had previously made
sure of the support of the praetorians, and so the appointment of Nero
to the principate transpired without opposition. The first five years
of his rule were noted as a period of excellent administration. During
that time his counsels were guided by the praetorian prefect, Afranius
Burrus from Narbonese Gaul, and by Lucius Annaeus Seneca, the
famous writer and orator from Spain, whom Agrippina had appointed
as his tutor in 49 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Fall of Agrippina.</hi> This epoch is also characterized by the attempt
of Agrippina to act as regent for her son and retain the influence
she had acquired during the later years of the life of Claudius.
But in this she was opposed both by Nero himself and his able
ad<pb n="233"/><anchor id="Pg233"/>visors. In 55 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Nero caused his adoptive brother Britannicus
to be poisoned, through fear that he might prove a rival. Finally,
under the influence of his mistress, Poppaea Sabina, the wife of Titus
Salvius Otho, he had Agrippina murdered (59 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Thereupon he
divorced Octavia, who was later banished and put to death, and married
Poppaea.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The government of Nero.</hi> Freed from the fear of any rival influence,
Nero, now twenty-two years of age, took the reins of government
into his own hands. After the death of Burrus in 62, Seneca
lost his influence over the princeps, who took as his chief advisor the
worthless praetorian prefect, Tigellinus. The Senate, whose support
he had courted in his opposition to Agrippina, now found itself without
any influence; and, since his wanton extravagances emptied the
treasury, Nero was forced to resort to oppressive measures to satisfy
his needs. The sole object of his policy was the gratification of his
capricious whims. In the conviction that he was an artist of extraordinary
genius, he hungered for the applause of the successful
performer, and in 65 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> publicly appeared in the theatre as a
singer and musician. Nothing could have more deeply alienated the
respect of the upper classes of Roman society. Eager to duplicate
his theatrical successes in the home of the Muses, in 66 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Nero
visited Greece and exhibited his talent at the Olympian and Delphic
games.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The fire in Rome and the first persecution of the Christians,
64 A. D.</hi> In 64 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> a tremendous fire, which lasted for six continuous
days and broke out a second time, devastated the greater part
of the city of Rome. Subsequently, Nero was accused of having
caused the fire, but there is absolutely no proof of his guilt. However,
he did seize the opportunity to rebuild the damaged quarter on a
new plan which did away with the offensive slum districts, and to
erect his famous <q>Golden House,</q> a magnificent palace and park
on the Esquiline. Popular opinion demanded some scapegoat for the
disaster, and Nero laid the blame upon the Christians in Rome, possibly
at the instigation of the Jews whose community was divided by
the spread of Christian doctrines. Many Christians were condemned
as incendiaries, and suffered painful and ignominious deaths. This
was the first persecution of the Christians.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Armenian problem, 51–67 A. D.</hi> In 51 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> an able and
ambitious ruler, Vologases, came to the Parthian throne. He soon
<pb n="234"/><anchor id="Pg234"/>found a chance to set his brother Tiridates on the throne of Armenia
and was able to maintain him there until the death of Claudius.
However, at the accession of Nero, Caius Domitius Corbulo was sent
to Cappadocia to reassert the Roman suzerainty over Armenia. At
first Vologases abandoned Armenia, owing to a revolt in Parthia, but
in 58 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Tiridates reappeared on the scene and war broke out.
In two campaigns Corbulo was able to occupy the country and set up
a Roman nominee as the Armenian king (60 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). It was not long
before the latter was driven out by Vologases, who succeeded in surrounding
a Roman force under Caesennius Paetus, the new commander
in Cappadocia, and forcing him to purchase his safety by
concluding an agreement favorable to the Parthian (62 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). The
situation was saved by Corbulo, then legate of Syria, who was finally
entrusted with the sole command of operations and forced Vologases
to meet the Roman terms (63 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Tiridates retained the Armenian
throne, but acknowledged the Roman overlordship by coming to
Rome to receive his crown from Nero’s hands.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The revolt in Britain, 60 A. D.</hi> Under Claudius the Romans
had extended their dominion in Britain as far north as the Humber,
and westwards to Cornwall and Wales. In 59 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> <anchor id="corr234"/><corr sic="Seutonius">Suetonius</corr>
Paulinus occupied the island of Mona (Anglesea), the chief seat of
the religion of the Druids. While he was engaged in this undertaking
a serious revolt broke out among the Iceni and Trinovantes,
who lived between the Wash and the Thames. It was caused by the
severity of the Roman administration and in particular the ill-treatment
of Boudicca, the queen of the Iceni, who headed the insurrection,
by Roman procurators. The Roman towns of Camulodunum
(Colchester), Verulamium (St. Alban’s), and Londinium (London)
were destroyed, and 70,000 Romans were said to have been massacred.
A Roman legion was defeated in battle and it was not until Paulinus
returned and united the scattered Roman forces that the insurgents
were checked. The Britons were decisively defeated and Boudicca
committed suicide.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The conspiracy of Piso, 65 A. D.</hi> About 62 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> there began a
long series of treason trials in Rome occasioned partly by the desire
to confiscate the property of the accused and partly by the suspicion
which is the inevitable concomitant of tyranny. The resulting insecurity
of the senatorial order naturally produced a real attempt
to overthrow the princeps. A wide-reaching conspiracy, in which one
<pb n="235"/><anchor id="Pg235"/>of the praetorian prefects was involved and which was headed by the
senator Gaius Calpurnius Piso, was discovered in 65 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Among
those who were executed for complicity therein were the poet Lucan
and his uncle Seneca. Other notable victims of Nero’s vengeance
were Thrasea Paetus and Borea Sonarus, the Stoic senators, whose
guilt was their silent but unmistakable disapproval of his tyrannical
acts. No man of prominence was safe; even the famous general Corbulo
was forced to commit suicide in 67 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The rebellion of Vindex, 68 A. D.</hi> Upon Nero’s return from
Greece, a more serious movement began in Gaul where Caius Julius
Vindex, the legate of the province of Lugdunensis, raised the standard
of revolt and was supported by the provincials who were suffering
under the pressure of taxation. Vindex was joined by Sulpicius
Galba, governor of Hither Spain, and other legates. The commander
of Upper Germany, Verginius Rufus, who remained true to Nero, defeated
Vindex, but, the revolt spread to the troops of Verginius himself
and these hailed their commander as imperator. He, however,
refused the honor and gave the Senate the opportunity to name the
princeps. Nero’s fate was sealed by his own cowardice and the
treachery of the prefect Sabinus, who bought the support of the praetorian
guards for Galba. The Senate followed their lead, and Nero,
who had fled from Rome, had himself killed by a faithful freedman.
With him ends the Julio-Claudian dynasty.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">V. The First War of the Legions or the Year of the Four
Emperors, 68–69 a. d.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The power of the army.</hi> The year 68–69 witnessed the accession
of four emperors, each the nominee of the soldiery. And, while
up to this time the praetorians had exercised the right of acclamation
in the name of the army as a whole, now the legions stationed on the
various frontiers asserted for themselves the same privilege. As
Tacitus expresses it, the fatal secret of the empire was discovered,
namely, that the princeps could be nominated elsewhere than in Rome.
Although the principate may be said to have been founded by the
universal consent of the Roman world, nevertheless, from its inception
the power of the princeps had rested directly upon his military
command, and the civil war of 68–69 showed how completely the
professional army was master of the situation.
</p>

<pb n="236"/><anchor id="Pg236"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Galba, 68 A. D.</hi> Galba, who succeeded Nero, was a man of good
family but moderate attainments and soon showed himself unable to
maintain his authority. That he would have been held <q>fit to rule,
had he not ruled,</q> is the judgment of Tacitus. He had never been
enthusiastically supported by the Rhine legions nor the praetorians,
and his severity in maintaining discipline, added to his failure to pay
the promised donative, completely alienated the loyalty of the guards.
At the news that the troops in Upper and Lower Germany had declared
for Aulus Vitellius, legate of the latter province (1 Jan., 69),
Galba sought to strengthen his position by adopting as his son and
destined successor, Lucius Calpurnius Piso, a young man of high
birth but no experience. By this step he offended Marcus Salvius
Otho, the onetime husband of Nero’s wife Poppaea Sabina, who had
been one of Galba’s staunch adherents and hoped to succeed him.
Otho now won over the disgruntled praetorian guards who slew Galba
and Piso, and proclaimed Otho Imperator.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Otho, Jan.–April, 69.</hi> The Senate acquiesced in their decision
but not so the legions of Vitellius which were already on the march
to Italy. They crossed the Alps without opposition but were checked
by the forces of Otho at Bedriacum, north of the Po. Without waiting
for the arrival of reinforcements from the Danubian army, Otho
ordered an attack upon the Vitellians at Cremona. His army was
defeated and he took his own life.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Vitellius, April–December, 69 A. D.</hi> Thereupon Vitellius was
recognized as princeps by the Senate and his forces occupied Rome.
Vitellius owed his nomination to the energy of the legates Valens and
Caecina, and, although well-meaning and by no means tyrannical,
showed himself lacking in energy and force of character. He was
unable to control the license of his soldiery who plundered the Italian
towns or his officers who enriched themselves at the public expense,
while he devoted himself to the pleasures of the table.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the army of the East, which had recognized Galba,
Otho and, at first, Vitellius also, set up its own Imperator, Titus
Flavius Vespasianus, who as legate of Judaea was conducting a war
against the Jews. Vespasian himself proceeded to occupy Egypt and
thus cut off the grain supply of Rome while his ablest lieutenant,
Mucianus, set out for Italy. The Danubian legions, who had supported
Otho, now declared themselves for Vespasian and, led by Antonius
Primus, marched at once upon Italy. The fleet at Ravenna
<pb n="237"/><anchor id="Pg237"/>espoused Vespasian’s cause, and Caecina, who led the Vitellians
against Primus, contemplated treachery. His troops, however, were
loyal, but were defeated in a bloody night battle at Cremona and the
way lay open to Rome. Vitellius then opened negotiations and offered
to abdicate, but his soldiers would not let him and suppressed a
rising in Rome led by the brother of Vespasian. Thereupon the city
was stormed and sacked by the army of Primus. Vitellius himself
was slain.

<hi rend="bold">Vespasian, December, 69 A. D.</hi> Vespasian obtained his recognition

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Caesar an imperial title.</hi> Following the example of Galba, Vespasian
on his accession took the name of Caesar, which became from
this time a prerogative of the family of the <anchor id="corr237"/><corr sic="princeps">princeps.</corr> The new
princeps inherited from his predecessors two serious wars, both national
revolts against Roman rule, the one in Gaul and Lower Germany,
the other in Judaea.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The revolt of the Batavi, 69 A. D.</hi> The movement in Lower
Germany was headed by Julius Civilis, a Batavian chieftain, formerly
an officer in the Roman service, who won over the eight Batavian
cohorts attached to the Rhine army. At first he posed as a
supporter of Vespasian against Vitellius, but at the news of the
former’s victory he renounced his allegiance to Rome and called to
his aid Germanic tribes from across the Rhine. At the same time
the Gallic Treveri and Lingones, the former led by Julius Classicus
and Julius Tutor, the latter by Julius Sabinus, rose in rebellion and
sought to establish an empire of the Gauls with its capital at Trèves
(Augusta Treverorum). They were joined by the Roman legions
stationed on the Rhine. However, the remaining peoples of Gaul
refused to join the revolt, preferring the Roman peace to a renewal
of the old intertribal struggles.
</p>

<p>
Upon the arrival of an adequate Roman force despatched by Vespasian
the mutinous legions returned to their duty, the Treveri and
Lingones were subdued, and Civilis forced to flee into Germany. The
Batavi returned to their former status of Roman allies under the
obligation of furnishing troops to the Roman armies (70 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). But
<pb n="238"/><anchor id="Pg238"/>Rome had seen the danger of stationing national corps under their
native officers in their home countries. Henceforth the auxiliaries
were no longer organized on a national basis and served in provinces
other than those in which they were recruited.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Jewish War, 66–70 A. D.</hi> From the year 6 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Judaea
had formed a Roman procuratorial province except for its brief incorporation
in the principality of Agrippa I (41–44 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). During
this time the Jews had occupied a privileged position among the
Roman subjects, being exempted from military service and the obligation
of the imperial cult, notwithstanding the design of Caligula to
set up his image in the temple at Jerusalem. These privileges were
the source of constant friction between the Jews and the Greco-Syrian
inhabitants of the cities of Palestine, which frequently necessitated the
interference of Roman officials. Another cause of unrest was the
pressure of the Roman taxation, which rendered agriculture unprofitable
and drove many persons from the plains to the mountains
to find a livelihood through brigandage. But a more deeply-seated
cause of animosity to Roman rule lay in the fact that the Jewish
people were a religious community and that for them national loyalty
was identical with religious fanaticism. The chief Jewish sects were
those of the Sadducees and the Pharisees, of whom the former composed
the aristocracy and the latter the democracy. The Sadducees
were supported by the Romans and monopolized the offices of the
religious community, whereas the Pharisees courted the support of the
masses by a policy of hostility to Rome and religious intolerance. It
is improbable that the Pharisees actually sought to bring about a
revolt but they kindled a fire which they could not control and
strengthened the development of a party of direct action, the Zealots,
who aimed to liberate Judaea from the Roman force, trusting in the
support of Jehovah. By 66 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> all Judaea was in a ferment and it
required but little incitement to produce a national revolt.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Massacres in Caesarea and Jerusalem, 66 A. D.</hi> Such a provocation
was afforded by the decision of the Roman government that
Jews were not entitled to citizenship in Caesarea, the Roman capital
of Judaea, and by a massacre of the Jews by the Greeks in a riot
which followed. However, at the same time in Jerusalem the Zealots
had overpowered the Roman garrison of one cohort, and massacred
both the Romans and their Jewish supporters. At the news, further
massacres took place in the towns of Syria and Egypt, the Jews
suffer<pb n="239"/><anchor id="Pg239"/>ing wherever they were in a minority but avenging their countrymen
where they got the upper hand. The Romans awoke to the seriousness
of the situation when the legate of Syria, Cestius Gallus, who
had marched on Jerusalem, was forced to beat an ignominious retreat.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Vespasian in command, 67 A. D.</hi> In 67 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Vespasian was
appointed to the command of an army of 50,000 assembled for the
reconquest of Judaea. In this and the following year he reduced the
open country and isolated fortresses, and was ready to begin the
blockade of Jerusalem, where the majority of the Jews had fled for
refuge. However, Vespasian’s elevation to the principate caused a
suspension of hostilities for ten months, during which factional strife
raged fiercely within the city.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Siege of Jerusalem, 70 A. D.</hi> The conclusion of the war Vespasian
entrusted to his eldest son Titus, who at once began the siege of
Jerusalem (70 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). The city had a double line of fortifications,
and within the inner wall were two natural citadels, the temple and
the old city of Mount Zion. The population, augmented by great
numbers of refugees, suffered terribly from hunger but resisted with
the fury of despair. The outer and inner walls were stormed, and
then the Romans forced their way into the temple which was destroyed
by fire. Mount Zion defied assault but was starved into submission.
Jerusalem was destroyed, and Judaea became a province
under an imperial legate. The political community of the Jews was
dissolved and they were subjugated to a yearly head-tax of two denarii
(40 cents) each, payable to the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, in consideration
of which they enjoyed their previous immunities. The
victory of Titus was commemorated by the arch which still stands
near the Roman forum.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The frontiers.</hi> The disorders of the recent wars rendered it necessary
for Vespasian to reorganize many branches of the administration,
a task which won for him the name of the second founder of the
principate. The security of the frontiers received his particular attention.
In Germany he annexed the territory between the Rhine
above its junction with the Main and the upper Danube, henceforth
known as the Agri Decumates from the tithe (<hi rend="italic">decuma</hi>) paid as
rental by colonists who settled there. Further east on the Danube
two strong legionary camps were constructed at Carnuntum and Vindobona
(Vienna). The Euphrates frontier was strengthened by the
establishment of Roman garrisons at Melitene and Satala on the
<pb n="240"/><anchor id="Pg240"/>Upper Euphrates, and by annexing to the Syrian province the kingdom
of Commagene, which Gaius had restored to its native dynasty.
Other client principalities met a like fate. Among the soldiery discipline
was restored by disbanding four of the mutinous Rhine legions
and replacing them with new units. The praetorian guard, dissolved
by Vitellius, was reconstituted out of Italian cohorts following the
precedent set by Augustus.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The finances.</hi> The most serious problem was that of the finances,
for the extravagance of the preceding emperors had left the government
in a state of bankruptcy and the provinces financially exhausted.
Vespasian estimated that the sum of $2,000,000,000 was required to
make the necessary outlays. To obtain this amount it was necessary
to impose new taxes and avoid all needless expenditures. Yet he
not only succeeded in making the state solvent but was able to carry
out extensive building operations in Italy and in the provinces. In
Rome the Capitoline Temple which had been burned in the fighting
with the Vitellians was rebuilt, a temple of Peace was erected on the
forum, and the huge Colosseum arose on the site of one of the lakes
of Nero’s Golden House. Vespasian also granted state support to
the teachers of Greek and Roman oratory in Rome.
</p>

<p>
In 74 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Vespasian assumed the censorship and took a census
of the empire in addition to filling the ranks of the Senate which
had been depleted by the late civil wars. He was generous in his
grants of citizenship to provincials, and bestowed the Latin right on
all the non-Roman communities of Spain, as a preliminary step to
their complete romanization.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Vespasian and the senate.</hi> Vespasian was the first princeps who
was not of the Roman nobility. He was a native of the Italian municipality
of Reate and his family was only of equestrian rank. He
was furthermore an eminently practical man who made no attempt
to disguise the fact that he was the real master in the state. Significant
in this respect was his revival of the <hi rend="italic">praenomen</hi> imperator,
which had been neglected by the successors of Augustus. He treated
the Senate with respect, and recognized its judicial authority, but
excluded it from all effective share in the government. A senatorial
decree and a law of the <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> conferred upon Vespasian the powers
of the principate, yet he dated the beginning of his reign from the
day of his salutation as Imperator by his army. All these things,
combined with his refusal to punish the informers of Nero’s reign,
<pb n="241"/><anchor id="Pg241"/>earned him the ill-will of the senators. Some of them proceeded to
open criticism of the princeps and a futile advocacy of republicanism
in the form of a cult of Brutus and Cato the Younger. The leader
of this group was Helvidius Priscus, son-in-law of Paetus Thrasea,
whom Nero had put to death, and like him a Stoic. Although not
very dangerous, such opposition could not be ignored and Priscus was
banished. He was later executed, probably for conspiracy. In all
probability it was the antimonarchical tendency of contemporary Stoic
teachings that induced Vespasian to banish philosophers from Rome.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The praetorian prefecture.</hi> To forestall any disloyalty in the
praetorian guard, Vespasian made his son Titus praetorian prefect.
Titus also received the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tribunicia potestas</hi>, and when
Vespasian died in 79 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> succeeded to the principate.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Titus, 79–81 A. D.</hi> His rule lasted little over two years, and is
chiefly remarkable for two great disasters. In 79 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> an eruption
of the volcano of Vesuvius buried the cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum,
and Stabii in Campania. Beneath the heavy deposit of volcanic ashes
the buildings of these towns have been preserved from disintegration,
and the excavation of the site of Pompeii has revealed with wonderful
freshness the life of an Italian municipality under the principate.
The following year Rome was devastated by a fire which raged
for three days and destroyed Vespasian’s new temple of Capitoline
Jupiter. In September, 81 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, Titus died, deeply mourned by the
whole Roman world.
</p>

        <index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="VII. Domitian, 81-96 A. D."/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">VII. Domitian, 81–96 a. d.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Character and policy.</hi> Titus was followed by his younger brother
Domitian, whom, on account of his ambition, neither Vespasian nor
Titus had permitted to share in the government. Domitian was a
thorough autocrat and his administration was characterized by great
vigor and capacity. Far from being a mere tyrant, he paid great attention
to the welfare of the provinces and exercised a strict supervision
over his officers. He also displayed a real interest in literature
and replaced the libraries destroyed in the fire of 80 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
</p>

<p>
His autocratic policy is clearly seen in his assumption of the censorship
as perpetual censor in 84 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, whereby he acquired complete
control over the composition of the Senate, a power which, without
the title, was henceforth one of the prerogatives of the princeps. Even
<pb n="242"/><anchor id="Pg242"/>more emphatically does his absolutism come to light in the title
    <hi rend="italic"><anchor id="corr242"/><corr sic="dominius">dominus</corr> et deus</hi> (Lord and God), which he required from the officers
of his household, and by which he was generally designated, although
he did not employ it himself in official documents. For the cult of
the deified emperors Domitian erected a special temple in Rome, and
he also established a priestly college of Flaviales, modelled on the
Augustales of Rome, to perpetuate the worship of his deified father
and brother.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Frontier policy: Britain.</hi> The desire for military successes as
a support for his absolutism led Domitian to adopt an aggressive
frontier policy. In Britain, Julius Agricola, legate from 77 to 84
<hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, led the Roman legions north of the Clyde and Firth of Forth
and defeated the united Caledonians under their chief Galgacus
(84 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). He also sent his fleet around the north of Scotland and
proved that Great Britain was an island. But his projects, which included
an invasion of Ireland, seemed too costly to Domitian who
recalled him, possibly in view of the military situation on the continent.
The conquest of Scotland was not completed and the Roman
authority was confined to the territory south of the Tyne.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Germany.</hi> In 83 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Domitian led an army across the Rhine
from Mainz and annexed the district of Wetterau, where the lowlands
were already in Roman hands although the hills were still
occupied by the hostile Chatti. A chain of forts was built to protect
the conquered region. In the winter of 88–89 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> the legate
of Upper Germany, Antonius Saturninus, was hailed as Imperator
by the two legions stationed at Mainz. Aid was expected by the
mutineers from the German tribes, but this failed to materialize and
the movement was suppressed by loyal troops, possibly from the lower
province. In consequence of this mutiny Domitian adopted the
policy of not quartering more than one legion in any permanent
camp. At the same time he separated the financial administration
of the German provinces from that of Gallia Belgica.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The lower Danube.</hi> More powerful neighbors faced the Romans
along the middle and lower Danube, and in dealing with these the
policy of Domitian was less successful. These people were the Germanic
tribes of the Marcomanni and Quadi in Bohemia, the Sarmatian
Iazyges between the Danube and the Theiss, and the Dacians,
who occupied the greater portion of modern Hungary and Roumania.
The most powerful of all were the Dacians, among whom a king
<pb n="243"/><anchor id="Pg243"/>named Decebalus had built up a strong state. In 85 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> they
crossed the Danube into Moesia, where they defeated and killed the
Roman governor. Thereupon Domitian himself took command and
drove the Dacians back across the river. But the pretorian prefect
Cornelius Fuscus in attempting to invade Dacia suffered a disastrous
defeat in which he and most of his army perished. His successor
Tettius Julianus was more successful. However, a complete victory
was prevented by Domitian, who rashly invaded the territory of the
Marcomanni and Iazyges, and was defeated by them. He thereupon
made peace with Decebalus, who gave up his prisoners of war and
acknowledged the formal overlordship of Rome, but received an annual
subsidy from Domitian in addition to the services of Roman
military engineers (89 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Although Domitian celebrated a triumph
for his exploits, his victory was by no means certain and his
settlement was only temporary. In the course of the Dacian war
Moesia was divided into two provinces.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Conflict with the Senate.</hi> Feeling that the army was the surest
support of his power, Domitian sought to secure its fidelity by increasing
the pay of the soldiers by one third. This new expense,
added to the outlays necessitated by his wars, the construction of
public works, like the restoration of the Capitoline Temple, and the
celebration of public festivals, forced him to augment the taxes and
this produced discontent in the provinces. In Rome, particularly
after the revolt of Saturninus, his relations with the Senate became
more and more strained. Many prominent senators were executed on
charges of treason; the teachers of philosophy were again banished
from Italy; and notable converts to Judaism or Christianity were
prosecuted, the latter on the ground of atheism. The general feeling
of insecurity produced the inevitable result; a plot in which the praetorian
prefects and his wife Domitia were concerned was formed
against his life; he was assassinated, 18 September, 96 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> His
memory was cursed by the Senate and his name erased from public
monuments. It was the oppression of the last years of Domitian’s
rule that so strongly biased the attitude of Tacitus towards the principate
and its founder.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Nerva and the Senate.</hi> Before assassinating Domitian, the conspirators
had secured a successor who would be supported by the
Senate and not prove inacceptable to the pretorians. Their choice
was the elderly senator Marcus Cocceius Nerva, one of a family distinguished
for its juristic attainments. He took an oath never to put
a senator to death, recalled the philosophers and political exiles, and
permitted the prosecution of informers. But he was lacking in force
and did not feel his position sufficiently secure to refuse the demands
of the praetorian guard for vengeance upon the murderers of Domitian.
Therefore to strengthen his authority he adopted a tried soldier,
Marcus Ulpius Traianus, the legate of Upper Germany. Trajan
received the tribunician authority and proconsular <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> (97
<hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The alimenta.</hi> Nerva’s administration benefitted Italy in particular.
Not only were the taxes and other obligations of the Italians
lessened, but the so-called alimentary system was devised in the interests
of poor farmers and the children of poor parents. Under
this system of state charity, sums of money were lent to poor landholders
at low rates of interest on the security of their land. The interest
from these loans was paid over to their respective municipalities
and expended by them in supporting the pauper children. The
scheme was perfected and extended by the succeeding princes.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">An era of internal peace.</hi> With Nerva begins a period in the
history of the principate that is characterized by amicable relations
between the princeps and the Senate. The basis of this concord was
the agreement by the successive emperors to acknowledge the freedom
of senators from the imperial jurisdiction. There was no longer any
question of an active participation by the Senate as a whole in the
administration, nevertheless it continued to exercise its influence
<pb n="245"/><anchor id="Pg245"/>through the official posts reserved for senators. In addition to the
establishment of these harmonious relations, the peaceful succession
of a number of able rulers who were designated by adoption and association
in the powers of the principate has caused this epoch to be
regarded as one of the happiest periods of Roman history.
</p>

<p>
Nerva died in January, 98 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, after a rule of less than two
years, and was succeeded by Trajan, who assumed office at Cologne.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Trajan’s character and policy.</hi> Trajan was a native of the Roman
colony of Italica in Spain, and the first provincial to attain the
principate. His accession is evidence not only for the degree of
romanization in the Spanish provinces but also for the decline of the
dominance of the strictly Italian element within the empire and the
transformation of the Italian into an imperial nobility of wealth
and office. The new princeps was above all things a soldier, and
the desire for military glory was his chief weakness. At the same
time he was an energetic and conscientious administrator, and showed
a personal interest in the welfare of Italy and the provinces, as we
see from his correspondence with the younger Pliny, governor of
Bithynia in 111–113 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> He respected the rights of the Senate
and repeated Nerva’s oath not to condemn one of that body to death.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The <anchor id="corr245"/><corr sic="Conquest">conquest</corr> of Dacia, 101–106 A. D.</hi> In the third year of his
rule Trajan undertook the conquest of Dacia, for Domitian’s agreement
with Decebalus was regarded as a disgrace and the existence of
a strong Dacian kingdom was a perpetual menace to the Danubian
frontier. Decebalus was still king of the Dacians and proved himself
a valiant opponent, but in two well-conducted campaigns (101–102
<hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>) Trajan forced him to sue for peace. He was obliged to
give up his engines of war with the Roman engineers whom he had
received from Domitian, to acknowledge Roman overlordship and
render military service to Rome. Trajan built a permanent stone
bridge across the Danube below the Iron Gates to secure communication
with the northern bank, and returned to Rome to celebrate his
victory with a triumph. But Decebalus was not content to remain
as a Roman vassal and made preparations to recover his people’s
independence. In 105 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> he opened hostilities by an invasion of
Moesia. However, Trajan hurried to the scene, secured the support
of the neighboring tribes, and in the following year entered Dacia.
His victory was complete, the capital of Decebalus was captured, the
king took his own life, and such of the Dacians as did not abandon
<pb n="246"/><anchor id="Pg246"/>their country were hunted down and exterminated. Dacia was made
a Roman province, and was peopled with settlers from various parts
of the empire, particularly from Asia Minor. The new province
was of importance both on account of its gold mines and its position
as a bulwark defending the provinces to the south of the Danube.
To commemorate his Dacian wars, Trajan erected a stone column,
one hundred feet high, in the new forum which bore his name.
The column, which is still in place, is adorned with a spiral band
of sculptured reliefs that vividly trace the course of the military
operations.
</p>

<p>
On other frontiers also Trajan strengthened or extended the boundaries
of the empire. In 106 he annexed the kingdom of the Nabataean
Arabs to the east of Palestine and Syria. From this was
formed the province of Arabia. In Africa also the Romans occupied
new territory, and secured it against Berber raids by creating new
fortresses at Lambaesis and Timgad.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Parthian war, 114–116 A. D.</hi> The peaceful relations which
had existed between Rome and Parthia since the time of Nero were
broken in 114 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> when the Parthian king Chosroes drove out the
Armenian ruler, who had received his crown from Trajan’s hands,
and set his own son Parthamasiris in his stead. Trajan at once
repaired to the East and concentrated an army for the invasion of
Armenia. Parthamasiris offered to acknowledge the Roman suzerainty
over Armenia, but Trajan determined to effect a definite settlement
of the eastern frontier by the permanent occupation of Armenia
and, for strategic reasons, of Mesopotamia also. In 114 he effected
an easy conquest of Armenia, and in the next year annexed Upper
Mesopotamia. He now resolved to complete his success by the overthrow
of the Parthian kingdom. Accordingly, in 116 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, he overran
Assyria and made it a province, and then pressed on to the
Persian gulf, capturing Seleucia, Babylon and the Parthian capital
Ctesiphon on his way. From dreams of further conquests Trajan
was recalled by a serious revolt in Mesopotamia which was only subdued
with great effort, and in 117 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Chosroes was able to reoccupy
his capital. At the same time the eastern provinces were disturbed
by a rising of the Jews, which began in Cyrene in 115 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> and spread
to Cyprus, Egypt and Mesopotamia. Horrible massacres were perpetrated
both by the Jews and their enemies, and large numbers of
troops had to be employed before order was restored.
</p>

<pb n="247"/><anchor id="Pg247"/>

<p>
News of revolts in Africa and Britain, and of troubles on the
Danubian border, led Trajan to set out for Rome. On the way he
fell ill and died at Selinus in Cilicia on 8 August, 117 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. Hadrian, 117–138 a. d.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Hadrian princeps.</hi> Trajan left no male heir and had associated
no one with himself in the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> or tribunician power. However,
on his deathbed he adopted his cousin and one-time ward,
Publius Aelius Hadrianus, also a native of Italica. Hadrian was
married to Sabina, a grand-daughter of Trajan’s sister Marciana.
He had had a distinguished military career and in 117 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> was
commander of the army in Syria. At the news of his adoption his
troops saluted him as Imperator and his nomination was confirmed
by the Senate. The only opposition came from some of the ablest
of Trajan’s officers, notably Lusius Quietus, who soon plotted against
his life. But their conspiracy was detected and the Senate condemned
to death the four leaders in the plot.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Hellenism.</hi> Hadrian was a man of restless energy and extraordinary
versatility. He had a keen appreciation of all forms of art
and literature, and a great admiration for Hellenism; an admiration
which probably arose from a realization of the fact that the culture
of the Roman empire was in its foundations Hellenic, but which
caused him to be scornfully dubbed a <q>Greekling</q> by the Roman
aristocracy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">General character of Hadrian’s government.</hi> In public life he
displayed the greatest devotion to duty, in the belief that <q>the ruler
exists for the state, not the state for the ruler,</q> and there was no
branch of the public administration that was not affected by his zeal.
Two extended tours, one in 121–126 and the other in 129–132 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>,
made him acquainted with conditions in the provinces and enabled
him to take measures to promote their welfare. The Senate he
treated with all outward marks of respect, taking the oath to respect
the lives of its members, but at the same time he regarded it as a
negligible factor in the government.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Military policy.</hi> Realizing that Trajan’s policy of imperial expansion
had overtaxed the economic resources of the empire, he began
his rule by abandoning the new provinces of Mesopotamia and
Assyria, and reverting to the previous Roman policy in Armenia,
<pb n="248"/><anchor id="Pg248"/>where a Parthian prince acknowledged his overlordship. He devoted
his energies to strengthening the system of frontier defences and raising
the standards of discipline and efficiency among the soldiers.
Aside from the suppression of the revolts which had broken out
in the last years of Trajan’s rule, his most serious military undertaking
was the quelling of a new rising of the Jews in Palestine,
which followed the foundation of a Roman colony on the site of
Jerusalem. Only after a two years’ struggle (132–134 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>) was
the rebellion crushed.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Judicial and administrative reforms.</hi> To aid him in the administration
of justice, Hadrian formed a permanent council of
eminent jurists. He, too, was responsible for codifying and editing
in a final form the praetor’s edict, upon which was based the
procedure of the Roman civil law. This task was carried out by
the jurist Salvius Julianus. With the object of relieving the city
courts of an excessive burden of judicial business, Hadrian divided
Italy into four districts, and appointed an official of consular rank
to administer justice in each. This was a further step in removing
Italy from the control of the Senate and approximating its status to
that of a province. Hadrian’s administrative reforms were the result
of the steady increase in the sphere of public business carried on by
the officers of the princeps, and furthered the development of a centralized
bureaucracy. By creating new offices—among them the post of
advocate of the fiscus (<hi rend="italic">advocatus fisci</hi>) as an alternative for the
subaltern military offices—he greatly increased the importance of
the equestrian career and the influence of the <hi rend="italic">equites</hi> in the government.
In the three departments of the military, civil and judicial
administration the principate of Hadrian marks a distinct epoch.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Building activity.</hi> Everywhere throughout the empire Hadrian
built and repaired with the greatest zeal; but particularly in Rome
and Athens. In Rome, among other structures, he built the great
double temple of Venus and Roma and his own mausoleum, the present
Castel Sant’ Angelo. At Athens he completed the great temple
of Olympian Zeus, begun by Pisistratus in the sixth century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>,
and added a new quarter to the city.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The choice of a successor.</hi> In 136 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, Hadrian fell seriously
ill and, having no children, adopted Lucius Ceionius Commodus
under the name of Lucius Aelius Caesar, and clothed him with the
tribunician authority. Hadrian himself withdrew from Rome to his
<pb n="249"/><anchor id="Pg249"/>splendid villa at Tibur. However, Aelius died at the beginning of
138 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, and thereupon the princeps adopted an elderly senator
named Titus Aurelius Antoninus, who in turn adopted the son of
the deceased Aelius and his own nephew, Marcus Annius Verus.
Antoninus received the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> and tribunician power and became
the partner of Hadrian in the principate. After a long and painful
illness the latter died in July, 138 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> His later years were clouded
by ill health which rendered him moody and suspicious, and probably
led to the execution of his brother-in-law and the latter’s grandson
on a charge of conspiracy. He had never been popular with the
Senate and this step widened the breach between them. Only the
energetic action of his successor prevented the execration of his memory
and secured his deification.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. The Antonines, 138–192 a. d.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Antoninus Pius, 138–161 A. D.</hi> Antoninus, who received the
name of Pius in the first year of his rule, was the personification
of ancient Roman piety, i. e. the dutiful performance of obligations
in public and private life. His mildness and uprightness enabled
him to act in perfect harmony with the senators, and as a concession
to them he removed the four <hi rend="italic">consulares juridici</hi> whom Hadrian had
appointed in Italy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">His public policy.</hi> Antoninus adhered to Hadrian’s peaceful
foreign policy, but had to wage several border wars and suppress some
insurrections in the provinces. In Britain a line of fortifications was
constructed from the Firth of Forth to the Clyde. Antoninus laid
great emphasis upon an upright administration of justice. At this
time, too, the Roman law was greatly enriched through the introduction
of principles of equity and began to receive at the hands of the
jurists the systematic form by which it was later characterized. In
147 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> he conferred the title of Caesar upon the elder of his adopted
sons, Marcus Aurelius, whom he had previously married to his daughter,
and took him as an associate in the government. Upon the death
of Antoninus in March, 161 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, Aurelius succeeded to the principate.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The dual principate—Marcus Aurelius, 161–180 A. D., and
Lucius Verus, 161–169.</hi> Marcus Aurelius at once took as associate
in the principate his adoptive brother, Lucius Verus, and for the first
time two Augusti shared the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>. But the real power rested
<pb n="250"/><anchor id="Pg250"/>in the hands of Aurelius, for Verus was a weak character, indolent
and sensual. Although he did not take the oath not to put a senator
to death, and restored the <hi rend="italic">consulares iuridici</hi> removed by Antoninus,
the elder Augustus respected the Senate and remained on good terms
with it. Marcus Aurelius was by nature a student and philosopher,
a devoted follower of the Stoic rule of life; his <hi rend="italic">Meditations</hi> bear testimony
to the true nobility of his character. Such was the princeps who
was fated to spend his remaining years in an unceasing struggle against
the enemies of the state and, true to his principles, he obeyed the call
of duty and devoted himself unsparingly to the public service.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Parthian war: 161–65 A. D.</hi> Even before the death of Antoninus,
Vologases III of Parthia had begun hostilities and had overrun
Armenia. The Roman legate of Cappadocia was defeated and the
Parthians broke into Syria, where they won another victory. The
situation was critical. Aurelius sent his colleague Verus to the
scene, and although the latter displayed neither energy nor capacity,
his able generals restored the fortunes of the Roman arms. In 163
Statius Priscus reëstablished Roman authority over Armenia and
placed a Roman vassal on the throne. In 164–65, Avidius Cassius
invaded Mesopotamia and took the Parthian capitals Seleucia and
Ctesiphon. Yet, on the march back, he suffered considerable losses
from hunger and disease, and a peace was made with Parthia which
gave the Romans territory in upper Mesopotamia to the east of the
Euphrates (166 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). But the returning troops brought with them
a plague which ravaged the whole empire and caused widespread
depopulation.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Wars with the Marcomanni, Quadi and Iazyges: 167–175 A. D.</hi>
In the meantime a dangerous situation had arisen on the Danubian
frontier, where, probably in consequence of the pressure of migratory
peoples, the Marcomanni, Quadi and the Sarmatian Iazyges united in
an attempt to force their way into the Roman provinces. The army
of the Danube had been weakened to reinforce the Syrian troops in
the Parthian war and this enabled the barbarians to penetrate the
frontier defences and ravage Noricum and Pannonia as far as Aquileia
at the head of the Adriatic. The two Augusti proceeded to the scene
of war, and after a protracted struggle in which Dacia suffered from
a hostile invasion, the enemy were forced to make peace. The Marcomanni
submitted in 172, and the Quadi and Sarmatians in 175 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
They were forced to surrender the prisoners carried off from the
<pb n="251"/><anchor id="Pg251"/>Roman provinces, over 160,000 in number, and to furnish military
aid to Rome, while large numbers of them were settled on waste
lands south of the Danube under the obligation of tilling the soil
and rendering military service. The Roman victory was commemorated
by the erection of a column at Rome with sculptures picturing
incidents of the war, in imitation of Trajan’s memorial. In
addition to the prosecution of this war, the strength of the empire
had been taxed by serious outbreaks in Mauretania, Gaul and Egypt.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Revolt of Avidius Cassius, 175 A. D.</hi> The complete subjugation
of the northern foe was hindered by the revolt of Avidius Cassius,
the general who had distinguished himself in the Parthian war and
had suppressed the revolt in Egypt. Verus, the colleague of Aurelius,
had died in 169, and at a rumor of the death of Aurelius himself in
175 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, Cassius proclaimed himself Imperator in Syria. Thereupon
Aurelius hastened to conclude peace with the Sarmatians and
proceeded to the East. Upon his arrival he found that Cassius had
been killed by his own soldiers. Soon afterwards Commodus, the
son of Aurelius, received the title Augustus and became co-ruler with
his father (177 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Second war with the Marcomanni and Quadi, 177–180 A. D.</hi>
In 177 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> war broke out anew with the Quadi and Marcomanni.
Aurelius again took command on the Danube and after two years’
fighting had won so complete a victory that he contemplated the
annexation of the region occupied by these peoples. But for a
second time he was robbed of the fruits of his toil, on this occasion
by the hand of death, 17 March, 180 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> The principate passed
to his son and colleague, Commodus.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Lucius Aurelius Commodus, <anchor id="corr251"/><corr sic="Sole Princeps">sole princeps</corr>, 180–192 A. D.</hi>
Lucius Aurelius Commodus, the ignoble son of a noble father, is
one of the few in the long line of Roman rulers of whom nothing
good can be said. Cowardly, cruel and sensual, he gave himself up
to a life of pleasure and left the conduct of the government in the
hands of a succession of favorites, who used their power to further
their own interests. He abandoned the war with the Marcomanni
and Quadi without carrying out his father’s plans and granted them
peace on lenient terms so that he might return to the enjoyments of
the capital. His chief ambition was to win fame as a gladiator.
He frequently appeared in the arena, and finally determined to
assume the consulate on 1 January, 193 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> in a gladiator’s
    cos<pb n="252"/><anchor id="Pg252"/>tume. However, on the preceding night he was assassinated at the
instigation of the pretorian prefect, Quintus Aemilius Laetus.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Pertinax: January–March, 193 A. D.</hi> The new princeps (Publius
Helvius Pertinax, a senator of low birth but proved military capacity)
was the nominee of Laetus. However, his strictness in enforcing
discipline among the troops and his economies, necessitated
by the exhausted condition of the public finances, soon alienated the
goodwill of the praetorians and Laetus himself. After less than three
months’ rule he was killed in a mutiny of the pretorian guard (March,
193 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Didius Julianus.</hi> Their choice for a successor was an old and
wealthy senator, Didius Julianus, who purchased his nomination by
the promise of a high donative. But his rule was destined to be
short for, as in 68 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, the armies on the frontiers asserted their
claim to appoint the princeps.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The <anchor id="corr252"/><corr sic="Rivals">rivals</corr>: Severus, Niger and Albinus.</hi> Almost simultaneously
three commanders were saluted as Imperator by their soldiers.
These were Pescennius Niger in Syria, Clodius Albinus in Britain,
and Septimius Severus in Upper Pannonia. With their nominations
a second war of the legions began. Severus had the advantage of
position and immediately marched on Rome as the avenger of Pertinax.
He also was able to arrange a truce with Albinus by promising
to recognize him as his successor with the title of Caesar. The
praetorians offered no resistance to the Danubian army; Julianus was
deposed by the Senate and put to death (June, 193 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>); and the
Senate ratified the nomination of Severus.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Defeat of Niger and Albinus.</hi> But the position of Severus was
not yet secure, for Niger had been recognized in the eastern provinces
and also had a strong following in Rome. He was preparing to march
upon Italy and had already occupied Byzantium. Severus at once
set out to anticipate his attack. After investing Byzantium he crossed
over to Asia Minor and defeated the forces of his rival near Cyzicus
and Nicaea, forcing them to withdraw south of the Taurus mountains.
The Cilician Gates were forced and Niger decisively beaten in a
battle at Issus (194 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). He tried to escape into Parthia but was
overtaken and killed. Severus advanced across the Euphrates to
<pb n="253"/><anchor id="Pg253"/>punish the Parthian king for his support of Niger. He occupied
northern Mesopotamia, and made Nisibis a Roman colony and frontier
fortress (196 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). In the same year Byzantium was taken,
its fortifications destroyed, and its inhabitants deprived of the right
of municipal organization. Severus had brought his Parthian campaign
to a hasty conclusion, for in the West Clodius Albinus, feeling
his position insecure, had assumed the title of Augustus and occupied
Gaul. Severus now elevated his eldest son Bassianus, better known
as Caracalla, to the position of Caesar with the additional title of
<hi rend="italic">imperator designatus</hi>, and set out to meet the usurper. In a great
battle at Lugdunum, in which 150,000 men are said to have fought
on either side, the army of Severus was <anchor id="corr253"/><corr sic="victorius">victorious</corr> and Albinus fell
by his own hand (197 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Many of his adherents, including
numerous senators, were put to death.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Parthian war of 197–199 A. D.</hi> Severus was now unchallenged
ruler of the empire. Shortly after the defeat of Albinus, he
returned to the East and resumed hostilities against the Parthians,
whose king, Vologases IV, had taken advantage of his absence to
invade Armenia and Mesopotamia and was besieging Nisibis. Severus
relieved the <anchor id="corr253a"/><corr sic="beleagured">beleaguered</corr> town and pressed on into the enemy’s
territory, where he sacked the two Parthian capitals, Seleucia and
Ctesiphon, in 198 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> By a peace arranged in the next year northern
Mesopotamia was ceded to Rome and was organized as a province
under a governor of equestrian rank.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">A <anchor id="corr253b"/><corr sic="Military Monarchy">military monarchy</corr>.</hi> Septimius Severus was a native of Leptis
in Africa. He came from an equestrian family and had begun his
official career as an advocate of the <hi rend="italic">fiscus</hi>. To secure the prestige of
noble lineage he caused himself to be proclaimed as the adopted son
of Marcus Aurelius, and took the latter’s family name of Antoninus
for himself and his house. His rule was frankly autocratic in character
and he made no attempt to disguise the fact that his authority
rested upon the support of the soldiery. Light is thrown upon Severus’
policy in general by the significant fact that under him Rome,
which he adorned with magnificent structures, received the title <hi rend="italic">sacra</hi>
(sacred), a term regularly used to designate things under the control
of the princeps. The activity of the Senate was limited to
register<pb n="254"/><anchor id="Pg254"/>ing its approval of his measures, and equestrians were appointed to
military posts hitherto filled only by senators. The special privileges
which Italy and the Italians had continued to enjoy were equally disregarded.
The title proconsul, which Trajan and his successors had
used in the provinces, was now employed by Severus in Italy. In
193 he disbanded the old praetorian guard, which had been recruited
from Italy and the more thoroughly latinized provinces, and organized
a new corps of picked troops drawn from the legions in general, but
especially those of the Danubian army. Severus enrolled three new
legions for the Parthian war and placed them under the command
of equestrian prefects instead of senatorial legates. Two of these
legions were stationed in Mesopotamia, but the third was quartered
at the Alban Mount in Latium. This step had the effect of reducing
Italy to the status of a garrisoned province, but it was probably taken
with the view of providing a larger reserve force to supplement the
frontier garrisons. Severus also was the author of many reforms
which improved the conditions or increased the rewards of military
service. The pay of the troops was raised, the legionaries were
allowed to contract a legal marriage when in service, and the equestrian
career was opened to veteran centurians. However, there seems to
be no proof that Severus deliberately fostered the barbarization of the
army by the exclusion of Italian centurians, or that he ruined the
discipline of the soldiers by permitting the married legionaries to
reside outside of barracks. To rescue the government from the state
of insolvency into which it had been brought by his predecessors,
Severus stood in need of a large sum of money. This he secured by
confiscating the estates of the adherents of Niger and Albinus.
</p>

<p>
Of signal importance was the increase in the power of the praetorian
prefecture at this time. This office was for a number of years held
by a single prefect, Publius Fulvius Plautianus, whose daughter was
married to the eldest son of Severus. However, his great power
proved his undoing, and in 205 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> he was executed on a charge of
treason made by his own son-in-law. At his death two prefects
were again appointed, one of whom was Papinian, the greatest of all
Roman jurists. His appointment seems to indicate a division between
the military and the civil functions of the prefecture. For
from this time the prefect exercised supreme jurisdiction over criminal
cases in Italy beyond the hundredth milestone from the city, and in
the matter of appeals from the judgments of provincial governors.
<pb n="255"/><anchor id="Pg255"/>In the absence of the princeps he also presided over the imperial
judicial council. Following Papinian other eminent jurists filled
this office. Furthermore, the supervision of the transportation of
grain to Rome was transferred from the prefect of the grain supply
to the praetorian prefect, and the former officer merely supervised its
distribution within the city.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">War in Britain, 208–211 A. D.</hi> Like Hadrian, Severus paid
great attention to strengthening the frontier defences of the empire,
particularly the fortifications which linked the Rhine and the Danube.
In 208 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> when Britain was invaded by the Caledonians, he took
the field, accompanied by his two sons. He reinforced Hadrian’s
earthen wall between the Tyne and the Solway by a wall of stone,
and carried on guerilla warfare against the tribes of the northern
part of the island. However, they had not been completely pacified
when he died at York in February, 211 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, leaving the principate
to his sons, Caracalla and Geta, both of whom had previously received
the title of Augustus.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Caracalla, 211–217 A. D.</hi> The bitter enmity which had long
existed between the two brothers continued during a year of joint
rule, and divided the empire into rival factions. Then Caracalla,
who had previously sought to make himself sole ruler, succeeded
in having Geta assassinated. Many of the latter’s friends, among
them the prefect Papinian, were executed. Caracalla was cruel and
vicious, and displayed no capacity for governing. He relied solely
upon the goodwill of the soldiery and courted their support by increased
pay and lavish donatives. In 212 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, by the famous Antonian
Constitution (<hi rend="italic">constitutio Antoniniana</hi>) he extended Roman
citizenship to all the provincials of the empire, except those who were
in a condition of vassalage, such as some of the barbarian peoples
who had been settled on waste lands within the Roman borders, and
not citizens of organized municipalities (<hi rend="italic">dediticii</hi>). This act was
the logical culmination of the policy of his predecessors who had
granted citizenship to many provincial municipalities and had sanctioned
its automatic extension to soldiers of the legions and auxiliary
corps. Perhaps Caracalla’s chief motive was to supply a fresh source
of income for the treasury, which was sadly depleted by his extravagances,
for he greatly increased the number of those liable to
the five per cent inheritance tax which fell only upon Roman citizens.
A second motive may well have been the desire to secure a
uniform<pb n="256"/><anchor id="Pg256"/>ity of legal status and of municipal organization throughout the
empire.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Germanic and Parthian wars.</hi> In 213 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> an attack of a confederacy
of German tribes, the Alamanni, upon the Raetian frontier
was successfully repelled, and in the next year Caracalla set out for
the East, where he planned to conduct a Parthian war in imitation
of the conquests of his idol, Alexander the Great. In 215, the
Parthian king, Vologases V, came to terms, but when he was dethroned
by his brother, Artabanos V, who refused Caracalla’s request
for the hand of his daughter, <anchor id="corr256"/><corr sic="Carcalla">Caracalla</corr> prepared to invade Parthian
territory. But before he embarked on his venture he was assassinated
by the order of the praetorian prefect Marcus Opellius Macrinus,
April, 217 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Macrinus, 217–218 A. D.</hi> Macrinus was recognized without opposition
as Caracalla’s successor, and bestowed upon his young son
Diadumenianus the title of Caesar. He was the first princeps who
had not attained senatorial rank. As a ruler he displayed moderation
and good sense, but was lacking in force. He purchased peace
from the Parthians, abolished oppressive taxes, and sought to lessen
the military burden by cancelling the increases of pay which Caracalla
had granted to the troops. This latter step cost him the support of
the soldiery, and part of the Syrian army declared its allegiance to
the fourteen-year-old Bassianus, a great-nephew of Julia Domna,
the Syrian wife of Septimius Severus. Bassianus could claim to be
a representative of the house of Severus, and consequently was hailed
as Imperator under the name of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. However,
he is better known as Elagabalus, for he was by hereditary right
the priest of the Sun God worshipped under that name at Emesa.
</p>

<p>
Macrinus tried to suppress the revolt, but he was defeated near
Antioch, and he and his son were captured and killed (June,
218 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Elagabalus, 218–222 A. D.</hi> Thereupon Elagabalus was universally
recognized as princeps and entered Rome in the following year.
There he introduced the worship of the sun as the supreme deity
of the Roman world, and added to the imperial title that of <q>most
exalted priest of the Unconquered Sun God Elagabalus.</q> His rule
was a riot of debauch, in which his associates were worthless favorites,
whom he appointed to the highest offices. His grandmother, Julia
Maesa, really conducted the government and, realizing his unfitness
<pb n="257"/><anchor id="Pg257"/>to rule, forced him to adopt his cousin Severus Alexander with the
title of Caesar in 221 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> When Elagabalus sought to rid himself
of his relative the praetorians forced him to make Alexander his colleague,
and finally murdered him (March, 222 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Severus Alexander, 222–235 A. D.</hi> Marcus Aurelius Severus
Alexander was now sole ruler. However, since he was a mere youth,
his mother, Julia Mamaea, daughter of Julia Maesa, exercised the
powers of a regent. As he grew up Alexander showed himself well-meaning
and conscientious, but lacking in self-reliance, and he never
emancipated himself from his mother’s tutelage. During his rule
the Senate enjoyed a temporary revival of influence. Two councils
of senators, one of sixteen and one of seventy members, acted as an
imperial cabinet and an advisory legislative council, respectively. At
this time, too, the praetorian prefecture became a senatorial office in
that it conferred senatorial rank upon its holder. An attempt was
made to remedy public abuses, in particular to restore discipline
among the troops, and to reduce the military expenditure. But the
army had gotten out of hand, especially the praetorians, from whose
anger Alexander was unable to protect the noted jurist Paul, who
held the praetorian prefecture.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The new Persian empire.</hi> The widespread military insubordination
was all the more dangerous since new and more aggressive
foes began to threaten the integrity of the empire. In 227 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> the
Parthian dynasty of the Arsacids was overthrown by the Persian Ardaschir
(Artaxerxes) who founded the dynasty of the Sassanids. The
establishment of this new Persian kingdom was accompanied by a
revival of the national Persian religion, Zoroastrianism, and of the
Persian claims to the eastern Roman provinces. In 231 the Persians
drove the Roman troops out of Mesopotamia and penetrated Cappadocia
and Syria. Alexander himself then went to the East, where he
took the offensive in the following year. The details of his campaign
are uncertain, but at any rate Mesopotamia was recovered and
Alexander celebrated a triumph over the Persians in Rome (233 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Germanic campaign and death of Severus Alexander.</hi>
But the northern frontier was threatened by the attacks of Germanic
tribes, and in 234 Alexander assumed the conduct of operations on
the Rhine, with his headquarters at Mainz. The barbarians were
induced to make peace, but only by the payment of subsidies, and
this cost Alexander the respect of the army, who were disgruntled
<pb n="258"/><anchor id="Pg258"/>at his policy of retrenchment and his subservience to his mother. A
mutiny broke out, led by Gaius Julius Verus Maximinus, a Thracian
of peasant origin who had risen from the ranks to high command.
Alexander and Julia Mamaea were put to death, and Maximinus
was proclaimed Augustus (March, 235 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). With his accession
began a half century of confusion and anarchy.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">VI. The Dissolution and Restoration of the Empire:
235–285 a. d.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The end of the pax Romana.</hi> The period of fifty years from
235 to 285 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> is a prolonged repetition of the shorter epochs of civil
war of 68–69 and 193–197 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> During this interval twenty-six
Augusti, including such as were colleagues in the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>, obtained
recognition in Rome and of these only one escaped a violent death.
In addition, there were numerous usurpers or <q>tyrants,</q> as candidates
who failed to make good their claims to the principate were called.
Almost all of these emperors were the nominees of the soldiery, and
at least possessed military qualifications that were above the average.
In general they conscientiously devoted themselves to the task of restoring
order in the empire, but their efforts were in the main nullified
by the treachery of their own troops and the rise of rival emperors.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The mutiny of the army.</hi> The main cause of this disorganization
lay in the fact that the professional army had lost all sense of
loyalty to the empire, an attitude already frequently evidenced by the
praetorians, and by the legions also under Caracalla and his successors.
Recruited, as the latter now were, almost entirely from the
frontiers of the Roman world, they felt no community of interest with
the inhabitants of the peaceful provinces and turned upon them, like
unfaithful sheep dogs upon the flocks whom it was their duty to guard.
The sole object of the troops was to enrich themselves by plunder
and the extortion of high pay and frequent largesses from the emperor
whom they supported. Hence, in the expectation of fresh rewards,
each army hailed as Imperator the commander who had led it to
victory over foreign foes or revolting soldiers of Rome.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Barbarian invasions.</hi> In addition to constant civil war, the
Roman world was exposed to all the horrors of barbarian invasions.
We have already noticed the rise of a new Persian state whose object
was the reëstablishment of the empire as it had existed prior to the
<pb n="259"/><anchor id="Pg259"/>conquests of Alexander the Great. Likewise on the whole extent
of the northern frontier new and more aggressive peoples assaulted
and penetrated the frontier defences. On the North Sea coast, between
the Rhine and the Weser were the Saxons whose ships raided the
shores of Britain and Gaul. Facing the Romans along the lower
Rhine were the Franks, along the upper Rhine the Alamanni, further
east on the upper Danube the Marcomanni, while on the eastern
frontier of Dacia and to the north of the Black Sea were situated
the Goths and the Heruli. The withdrawal of troops from some
sectors of the frontier to meet attacks at others and the neglect of their
duty by the army corps who plunged into the maelstrom of civil war
in support of various candidates for the imperial power gave the
northern barbarians the opportunity to sweep down in destructive
hordes upon the peaceful and undefended provinces.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Dissolution of the empire.</hi> The natural consequence of the
failure of the imperial government to defend the provinces from
hostile invasions was that the provincials began to take measures for
their own protection and to transfer their allegiance from the Roman
emperors to local authorities, who proved a more efficient help in
time of trouble. These separatist tendencies were active both in the
East and in the West and led to a temporary dissolution of the
unity of the Empire.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Pestilence.</hi> A third scourge which afflicted the Roman world at
this critical period was a pestilence which, originating in the East,
entered the Empire about 252 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, and raged for fifteen years.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Valerian and Gallienus: 253–268 A. D.</hi> The fortunes of the
Empire reached their lowest ebb under Valerian and his son Gallienus
(253–268 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). In 256, the Persians invaded Mesopotamia and
Syria, and captured Antioch. Valerian at once undertook the defence
of the eastern provinces, leaving Gallienus in charge of the
West. Antioch was recovered, but when Valerian entered Mesopotamia
to relieve the blockade of Edessa, he was defeated by the
Persian king Sapor, and taken prisoner (258 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). He died soon
afterwards in captivity. The Persians not only reoccupied Antioch
but also seized Tarsus in Cilicia and Caesarea in Cappadocia, and
ravaged Asia Minor to the shores of the Aegean Sea.
</p>

<p>
While Valerian was waging his ill-fated war in the East, the rest
of the empire was in a continual state of turmoil. In 257 the Goths
and other peoples overran Dacia, crossed the Danube and penetrated
<pb n="260"/><anchor id="Pg260"/>as far south as Macedonia and Achaia. In 258 a revolt broke out
in Mauretania. The Berber tribesmen, led by an able chief, Faraxen,
invaded the province of Numidia, and were only reduced to submission
by the capture of their leader (260 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). At the same time
the Alamanni broke into Raetia, and made their way over the Alps
into the Po valley. Gallienus hastened to the rescue and defeated
them near Milan. But in his absence in Italy the Franks crossed
the Rhine and poured in devastating hordes over Gaul and Spain.
The Roman possessions on the right bank of the Rhine were lost at
this time and never recovered.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The empire of the Gauls.</hi> At the news of the death of Valerian
the commander in Pannonia, Ingenuus, raised the standard of revolt.
After defeating him, Gallienus found another serious rival in Regalianus,
whom, however, he was likewise able to overcome. But at
the same time (258 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), Marcus Cassius Latinius Postumus, whom
Gallienus had left in command in Gaul, assumed the imperial title,
after a victory gained over a body of Franks. He was able to clear
Gaul of its foes and make himself master of Britain and Spain.
Gallienus was powerless to depose him. Postumus did not endeavor
to establish a national Gallic state but regarded himself as exercising
the Roman <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> in a portion of the empire. He fixed his capital
at Trèves, and organized a senate and other institutions on the Roman
model. His coins bore the inscription <hi rend="italic">Roma Aeterna</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Palmyra.</hi> In the Orient the Persians were unable to retain their
hold on Syria and Asia Minor. Their withdrawal was in large
measure caused by the activities of Odaenathus, the ruler of the city
of Palmyra, who inflicted a severe defeat upon Sapor and recovered
Roman Mesopotamia. Thereupon two brothers, Fulvius Macrianus
and Fulvius Quietus, sons of an officer who had distinguished himself
against the Persians, were acclaimed as emperors in Asia Minor.
However, the one was defeated in attempting to invade Europe and
the other was overthrown by Odaenathus. In recognition of his
services Gallienus bestowed upon him the title of <q>Commander of the
East</q> (<hi rend="italic">dux orientis</hi>), with the duty of protecting the East (264
<hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). In Palmyra, he ruled as <hi rend="italic">basileus</hi>, or king, and although he
nominally acknowledged the overlordship of the Roman emperor, he
was practically an independent sovereign.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Goths.</hi> A fresh peril arose in the maritime raids of the
Goths, Heruli, and other tribes who had seized the harbors on the
<pb n="261"/><anchor id="Pg261"/>north coast of the Black Sea. With the ships that they thus secured
they ravaged the northern coast of Asia Minor as early as 256 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
In 262 they forced the passage of the Bosphorus and Hellespont and
plundered the shores of the Aegean. Their most noted raid was in
267, when they sacked the chief cities of Greece, including Athens.
</p>

<p>
No less than eighteen usurpers, for the most part officers who had
risen from the ranks, had unsuccessfully challenged the authority of
Gallienus in the various provinces. At last, in 268 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, one of his
leading generals, Aureolus, laid claim to the imperial title. Gallienus
defeated him and was besieging him in Milan, when he was killed
at the instigation of his officers, who proclaimed as his successor one
of their own number, Marcus Aurelius Claudius.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Claudius Gothicus, 268–270 A. D.</hi> The rule of Claudius lasted
only two years, in which his greatest achievement was the crushing
defeat which he inflicted upon the Goths who had again overrun
Greece and the adjacent lands (269 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). This victory won him
the name of Gothicus. Upon the death of Claudius in 270 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>,
the army chose Lucius Domitius Aurelianus as emperor.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Lucius Domitius Aurelianus, 270–275 A. D.</hi> Aurelian’s first
task was to clear Italy and the Danubian provinces of barbarian invaders.
Two incursions of the Alamanni into Raetia and Italy
were repulsed, the latter with great slaughter. But the emperor
recognized that the security of Italy could no longer be guaranteed
and so he ordered the fortification of the Italian cities. The imposing
wall which still marks the boundary of part of ancient Rome was
begun by Aurelian. A horde of Vandals were beaten and driven out
of Pannonia and a victory was won over the Goths in Moesia. But
the exposed position of Dacia, and the fact that it was already in large
part occupied by the barbarians, induced Aurelian to abandon it
altogether. The rest of the Roman settlers were withdrawn to Moesia,
where a new province of Dacia was formed behind the barrier of the
Danube.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The overthrow of Palmyra.</hi> Aurelian was now ready to attempt
his second and greater task, the restoration of imperial unity. And
in this the East first claimed his attention. There Vaballathus, the
son of Odaenathus, ruled over Palmyra, supported and directed by
his mother, Zenobia. At the outset Aurelian had recognized his
position but in 271 Vaballathus assumed the title of Augustus and
thereby declared his independence of Roman suzerainty. He was
<pb n="262"/><anchor id="Pg262"/>able to extend his authority over Egypt and a great part of Asia
Minor. In 272 Aurelian set out to bring back the East to its allegiance.
He speedily recovered Asia Minor, and entered Syria, where
he signally defeated the famous Palmyrene archers and mailed horsemen
at Emesa. He then crossed the desert and laid siege to Palmyra
itself. Zenobia tried to escape, but was taken, and the city surrendered.
The queen and her family were carried off to Rome but
Palmyra was at first spared. However, it rebelled again when Aurelian
had set out for Rome. Thereupon the emperor returned with
all speed and recaptured the city. This time it was utterly destroyed.
The authority of Rome was once more firmly reëstablished in the East.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The reconquest of Gaul.</hi> Following his conquest of Palmyra,
Aurelian proceeded to overthrow the already tottering empire of the
Gauls. At the death of Postumus in 268, Spain and Narbonese Gaul
had acknowledged the Roman emperor Claudius Gothicus. After
several successors of Postumus had been overthrown by the mutinous
Gallic soldiery, Publius Esuvius Tetricus was appointed emperor in
Gaul and Britain. However, foreseeing the speedy dissolution of
his empire, he secretly entered into negotiations with Aurelian. The
latter invaded Gaul and met the Gallic army at the plain of Chalons.
In the course of the battle, Tetricus went over to Aurelian, who won
a complete victory. Britain and Gaul submitted to the conqueror
(274 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Thus the unity of the empire was restored and Aurelian
assumed the title of <q>Restorer of the World</q> (<hi rend="italic">restitutor orbis</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Dominus et deus natus.</hi> Not only was Aurelian one of the greatest
of Roman commanders; he also displayed sound judgment in his
administration. Here his chief work was the suppression of the
debased silver currency and the issuing of a much improved coinage.
Aurelian regarded himself as an absolute monarch and employed on
his coins the titles <hi rend="italic">dominus et deus natus</hi>—<q>born Lord and God.</q>
He likewise reëstablished in Rome the official cult of the Unconquered
Sun God, previously introduced by Elagabalus. One of the characteristics
of this cult was the belief that the monarch was the incarnation
of the divine spirit, a belief which gave a moral justification to
absolutism.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Probus, 276–282 A. D.</hi> Aurelian was murdered in 275 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, and
was succeeded by Tacitus, who met a like fate after a rule of less
than two years. He was followed by Marcus Aurelius Probus, an
able Illyrian officer. Probus was called upon to repel fresh invasions
<pb n="263"/><anchor id="Pg263"/>of Germanic peoples, to subdue the rebellious Isaurians in Asia Minor
and suppress a revolt in Egypt. Everywhere he successfully upheld
the authority of the empire, but his strict discipline eventually cost
him the favor of the soldiers who hailed as Imperator Marcus Aurelius
Carus. Probus was put to death (282 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Like his predecessor,
Carus was a general of great ability. He appointed his eldest son
Carinus Augustus as his co-ruler, and left him in charge of the
West while he embarked on a campaign against the Persians. This
was crowned with complete success and terminated with the capture
of Ctesiphon. But on his return march he died, probably at the
hands of his troops (283 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). His younger son, the Caesar Numerianus,
who took command of the army, was assassinated by the
praetorian prefect Aper. However, the choice of the army fell upon
Gaius Valerius Aurelius Diocletianus, who assumed the imperial title
in September, 284 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> But Carinus had retained his hold upon
the West and <anchor id="corr263"/><corr sic="advancd">advanced</corr> to crush Diocletian. In the course of a
battle at the river Margus in Moesia he was murdered by his own
officers (285 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), and with the victory of Diocletian a new period
of Roman history begins.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">I. The Victory of Autocracy</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The senate and the appointment of the princeps.</hi> In the preceding
chapters we have traced in outline the political history of the
principate to the point where it had become an undisguised military
autocracy. This change is clearly seen in connection with the imperial
nomination. The appointment to the principate originally involved
the conferment of the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>, the tribunician power and
other rights and privileges. The <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> might be bestowed either
by a senatorial decree or through the acclamation as <hi rend="italic">imperator</hi> by a
part of the soldiery. Each of these forms was regarded as valid,
but was regularly confirmed by the other. But the tribunician authority
and the remaining powers of the princeps were conferred only
by a decree of the Senate, confirmed, during the first century at least,
by a vote of the Assembly of the Centuries. However, after the accession
of Carus (282 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), the Senate, which could no longer claim
to exercise any authority in the state, ceased to participate in the
appointment of the new ruler. This marks the formal end of the
principate.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Senate’s loss of administrative power. I. Rome and
Italy.</hi> The constitutional history of the principate is the story of
the gradual absorption of the Senate’s powers by the princeps and the
supplanting of the Senate’s officers by those in the imperial service.
It has been well said that Augustus aimed at the impossible when he
sought to be the chief magistrate in the state without being at the
same time the head of the administration. He had intended that the
Senate should conduct the administration of Rome, Italy and the ungarrisoned
provinces, but, as we have seen, he himself had been
brought by force of circumstances to take the initial steps in infringing
upon the Senate’s prerogatives. Not only did he take over the
<pb n="265"/><anchor id="Pg265"/>duties of provisioning and policing the city by establishing the prefectures
of the grain supply and the watch, but he also assumed responsibility
for the upkeep of the public buildings, streets and aqueducts
of Rome, as well as the highways of Italy. These departments
of public works were put in charge of commissioners of senatorial
rank, called curators, whom the princeps nominated. However, from
the time of Claudius equestrian officials, entitled procurators, were
appointed to these departments and became their real directors.
Finally, under Septimius Severus, the senatorial curators were dispensed
with.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">II. The aerarium.</hi> Augustus had left to the Senate the control of
the public treasury, the <hi rend="italic">aerarium</hi>, which was maintained by revenues
from the senatorial provinces and Italy. But when the princeps
came to assume control of those branches of the administration the
expense of which was defrayed by the <hi rend="italic">aerarium</hi>, it was inevitable
that the treasury itself should pass in some degree under his supervision.
And so in 44 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> the princeps began to designate two
quaestors to be in charge of the treasury for a three-year period.
Under Nero the place of these quaestors was taken by two prefects
appointed in the same manner but from among the ex-praetors. The
importance of the <hi rend="italic">aerarium</hi> declined in proportion as its revenues
passed into the hands of the ministers of the princeps, until in the
period between Septimius Severus and Diocletian it sank to the position
of a municipal chest for the city of Rome.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">III. The senatorial provinces.</hi> In the early principate the senatorial
provinces were administered by appointees of the Senate, all
of whom now bore the title of proconsul, assisted as in former days
by quaestors. However, only the proconsul of Africa was at the same
time commander of a provincial garrison, and his command was transferred
to the imperial governor of Numidia by Caligula. Even in
the time of Augustus the imperial procurators had appeared in the
senatorial provinces in charge of the revenues which were at the disposal
of the princeps, and, before the close of the third century they
were in complete control of the financial administration of these
provinces. But long before this, by the opening of the second century,
the princeps had usurped the Senate’s privilege of appointing
the proconsuls. The result was that by the close of the principate
all the provinces without distinction were equally under imperial
control.
</p>

<pb n="266"/><anchor id="Pg266"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Restriction of Senate’s elective powers.</hi> It was Tiberius who
transferred to the Senate the electoral functions of the Assembly but
he, as Augustus before him, limited the Senate’s freedom of action
by the recommendation of imperial candidates for the lower magistracies.
From the time of Nero the consulship also was regularly
filled by nominees of the emperors. The custom of appointing several
successive consular pairs in the course of each year, each pair
functioning for two or four months, greatly weakened the influence
of the consulate, while it enabled the emperors to gratify the ambitions
of a larger number of candidates for that office.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Loss of legislative functions.</hi> The rapid disappearance of the
Assembly resulted in the transfer of its sovereign legislative powers to
the Senate. The decrees of the Senate thus acquired the validity of
laws and after the time of Nerva comitial legislation completely
ceased. However, the influence of the princeps encroached more and
more upon the legislative freedom of the Senate until in the time of
the Severi the senatorial decrees were merely proclamations of the
princeps (<hi rend="italic">orationes principis</hi>) which were read to the Senate and approved
by it. Furthermore, the princeps developed independent legislative
power and by the middle of the second century the ordinances
or constitutions of the princeps had acquired the force of law. Early
in the third century legislation of this type altogether <anchor id="corr266"/><corr sic="superceded">superseded</corr>
the senatorial decrees. The imperial constitutions included edicts,
<hi rend="italic">decreta</hi>, or judicial verdicts, responses to the petitions of officers of
the princeps or private citizens, and mandates or instructions to his
subordinates. Originally, the edicts were only valid during the principate
of their author and the other forms of constitutions merely
applied to special cases. However, in course of time, they all alike
came to be recognized as establishing rules of public and private law
which remained in force unless they were specifically revoked by
another imperial constitution.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The administration of justice.</hi> The republican system of civil
and criminal jurisdiction was inherited by the principate, and the
courts of the praetors continued to function for Rome and Italy,
while the proconsuls were in charge of the administration of justice
in the senatorial provinces. In addition the Senate, under the presidency
of the consuls, acted as a tribunal for the trial of political
offences and criminal charges brought against members of the senatorial
order. The Senate also served as a court of appeals from the
<pb n="267"/><anchor id="Pg267"/>decisions of the proconsuls. But from the time of Augustus the
princeps exercised an unlimited right of jurisdiction which enabled
him to take cases under his personal cognizance (<hi rend="italic">cognitio</hi>), or appoint
a delegate to try them. The imperial officials administered justice
in their respective spheres by virtue of delegated authority and consequently
appeals from their courts were directed to the princeps.
The development of judicial functions by the military and administrative
officials of the princeps in Rome—the praetorian prefect, the
city prefect, the prefects of the watch and the prefect of the grain
supply—seriously encroached upon the judicial power of the praetors.
In addition, the <hi rend="italic">consulares</hi> of Hadrian, and the <hi rend="italic">iuridici</hi> of Marcus
Aurelius further limited the sphere of the praetorian courts. Ultimately,
under Septimius Severus, we find the city prefect as the
supreme judicial authority for all criminal cases arising in Rome or
within a radius of one hundred miles of the city and also exercising
appellate jurisdiction in civil cases within the same limits, subject
however, to an appeal to the court of the princeps. For the rest of
Italy, the court of the praetorian prefect was now the highest tribunal
in both criminal and civil suits. By this time also the princeps had
acquired supreme appellate jurisdiction for the whole empire, a
power which was regularly exercised by the praetorian prefect acting
in his place, In the third century the Senate ceased to exercise any
judicial authority whatever.
</p>

<p>
As a result of the above processes the princeps became in the end
the sole source of legislative, administrative and judicial authority.
The republican magistrates had become practically municipal officers,
and one of them, the aedileship, disappeared in the third century.
The complete victory of the princeps over the Senate is marked by
the exclusion of senators from military commands under Gallienus,
and their removal from the provincial governorships in which they
had continued to exercise civil authority between the time of Aurelian
and the accession of Diocletian.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The friction between the Senate and the princeps.</hi> It might
be thought that owing to the gradual admission to the Senate of the
nominees of the princeps that harmony would have been established
between the two administrative heads of the state. But although this
new nobility was thoroughly loyal to the principate, they proved
just as tenacious of the rights of the Senate as the descendants of the
older nobility who preserved the tradition of senatorial rule.
Au<pb n="268"/><anchor id="Pg268"/>gustus and Tiberius endeavored to govern in concord with the Senate
by organizing an advisory council appointed from the Senate, but
their successors abandoned the practice. The friction between the
princeps and the Senate was due in part to the realization that it
was from the senatorial order that rivals might arise and in part to
the fact that those emperors who did not interpret their position, as
did Augustus, in the light of a magistracy responsible to the Senate,
were bound to regard the Senate’s powers as restrictions upon their
own freedom of action, and as an unnecessary complication of the
administration. The chief services of the Senate were to provide a
head for the government when the principate was vacant, and to
furnish the only means for the expression of opinion with regard to
the character of the administration of the individual emperors. The
spontaneous deification or the <hi rend="italic">damnatio memoriae</hi> of a deceased princeps
was not without weight, for it expressed the opinion of the most
influential class in the state.
</p>

<p>
While the Senate as a body was thus stripped of its power, the
senatorial order remained a powerful class. Originally embracing
the chief landholders of Italy, it came to include those of the whole
empire. Collectively the senators lost in influence, but individually
they gained. By the end of the second century the senatorial order
had acquired an hereditary title, that of <hi rend="italic">clarissimus</hi> (most noble),
indicative of their rank.
</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. The Growth of the Civil Service</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The first steps.</hi> The necessary counterpart to the assumption
of administrative duties by the princeps was the development of an
imperial civil service, the officials of which were nominated by the
princeps, and promoted or removed at his pleasure. In this Augustus
had taken the first steps by the establishment of equestrian procuratorships
and prefectures, and the opening up of an equestrian career, but
the number of these posts greatly increased with the extension of the
administrative sphere of the princeps at the expense of the Senate.
The idea of conducting the government through various departments
manned by permanent salaried officials was absolutely foreign to the
Roman republic, which only employed such servants for clerical positions
of minor importance in Rome. However, the chaotic conditions
which had resulted from the republican system showed the need of a
<pb n="269"/><anchor id="Pg269"/>change, and the concentration of a large share of the administration
in the hands of the princeps both required and gave the opportunity
for the development of an organized civil service. This development
was unquestionably stimulated and influenced by the incorporation
in the Roman empire of the kingdom of Egypt, which possessed a
highly organized bureaucratic system that continued to function unchanged
in its essential characteristics.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The imperial secretaryships.</hi> At first the imperial civil service
lacked system and there was little or no connection between the
various administrative offices in Italy and in the provinces. Augustus
and his immediate successors conducted the administration as part
of their private business, keeping in touch with the imperial officials
through the private secretaries of their own households, that is to say,
their freedmen, who, in another capacity, conducted the management
of the private estate of the princeps. An important change was introduced
under Claudius, when his influential freedmen caused the
creation within the imperial household of a number of secretaryships
with definite titles that indicated the sphere of their duties. The
chief of these secretaryships were the <hi rend="italic">a rationibus</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">ab epistulis</hi>,
the <hi rend="italic">a libellis</hi>, the <anchor id="corr269"/><hi rend="italic">a <corr sic="cognitionibius">cognitionibus</corr></hi> and the <hi rend="italic">a studiis.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">a rationibus</hi>
acted as a secretary of the treasury, being in charge of the finances
of the empire which were controlled by the princeps; the <hi rend="italic">ab epistulis</hi>
was a secretary for correspondence, who prepared the orders which
the princeps issued to his officials and other persons; the <hi rend="italic">a libellis</hi>
was a secretary for petitions, who received all requests addressed to
the princeps; the <anchor id="corr269a"/><hi rend="italic">a <corr sic="cognitionibius">cognitionibus</corr></hi> served as a secretary for the imperial
inquests, entrusted with the duty of preparing the information
necessary for the rendering of the imperial decision in the judicial
investigations personally conducted by the princeps (<hi rend="italic">cognitiones</hi>);
and the <hi rend="italic">a studiis</hi>, or secretary of the records, had the duty of searching
out precedents for the guidance of the princeps in the conduct of
judicial or administrative business. The establishment of these secretaryships
in the imperial household tended to centralize more completely
the imperial administration and to give it greater uniformity
and regularity. At the same time the influence of the freedmen who
occupied these important positions was responsible for the admission
of freedmen to many of the minor administrative procuratorships.
It was under Claudius also that the preliminary military career of the
procurators was more definitely fixed.
</p>

<pb n="270"/><anchor id="Pg270"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The reforms of Hadrian and Septimius Severus.</hi> Hadrian took
the next decisive step in the development of the central administrative
offices when he transformed the secretaryships of the imperial household
into secretaryships of state by filling them with equestrians of
procuratorial rank in place of imperial freedmen. From this time
the latter were restricted to minor positions in the various departments.
Under Hadrian also there was a marked increase in the number of
administrative procuratorships owing to the final abolition of the system
of farming the revenues and their subsequent direct collection
by imperial officials as well as the establishment of the public post
as a means of intercourse throughout all the provinces. It was
possibly with the object of supplying the necessary officials to undertake
these new tasks that Hadrian created the office of the advocate
of the <hi rend="italic">fiscus</hi> as an alternative for the preliminary military career of
the procurators.
</p>

<p>
Septimius Severus, as we have seen, opened the posts of the civil
administration to veteran officers upon the completion of a long period
of military service. Thus, although a purely civil career was established,
which led ultimately to the highest prefectures, nevertheless,
during the principate the civil administrative offices were never completely
separated from the traditional preliminary military service.
It was Septimius Severus also who made the praetorian prefect, as the
representative of the princeps, the head of the civil as well as of the
military administration.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The salary and titles of the equestrian officials.</hi> The ordinary
career of an official in the imperial civil service included a
considerable number of procuratorships in various branches of the
administration, both in Rome, Italy and the provinces. Although
from the time of Augustus a definite salary was attached to each of
these offices, it was not until after the reforms of Hadrian that four
distinct classes of procurators were recognized on the basis of the
relative importance of their offices expressed in terms of pay. These
four classes of procurators were the <hi rend="italic">tercenarii</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ducenarii</hi>, <hi rend="italic">centenarii</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">sexagenarii</hi>, who received respectively an annual salary of 300,000,
200,000, 100,000 and 60,000 sesterces; this classification remained
unchanged until the close of the third century. At that time
the highest class included the imperial secretaries of state, whose title
was now that of <hi rend="italic">magister</hi>, or master. The salary of the four chief
prefectures was probably higher still.
</p>

<pb n="271"/><anchor id="Pg271"/>

<p>
Following the example of the senatorial order, the equestrians also
acquired titles of honor, which depended upon their official rank.
From the time of Hadrian the title <hi rend="italic">vir eminentissimus</hi> (most eminent)
was the prerogative of the praetorian prefects. Under Marcus Aurelius
appear two other equestrian titles, <hi rend="italic">vir perfectissimus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vir egregius</hi>.
In the third century the latter was borne by all the imperial procurators,
while the former was reserved for the higher prefectures
(apart from the praetorian), the chief officials of the treasury and the
imperial secretaries.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Administration of the finances: (I). The Fiscus.</hi> The most
important branch of the civil administration was that of the public
finances, which merits special consideration. Augustus did not centralize
the administration of the provincial revenues which were at
his disposal, but created a separate treasury or <hi rend="italic">fiscus</hi> for each imperial
province. However, he did establish the <hi rend="italic">aerarium militare</hi>
at Rome for the control of the revenues destined for the pensioning
of veteran troops. Furthermore, Augustus drew a sharp distinction
between the public revenues which were administered by the princeps
in his magisterial capacity, and the income from his own private
property or patrimony. For the expenditure of the former he acknowledged
a strict accountability to the Senate. The policy of Augustus
was followed by Tiberius and Caligula, but under Claudius a central
<hi rend="italic">fiscus</hi> was organized at Rome for the administration of all the public
revenues of the princeps. The provincial <hi rend="italic">fisci</hi> disappeared, and the
military treasury became a department of the <hi rend="italic">fiscus</hi>. This new imperial
<hi rend="italic">fiscus</hi> was under the direction of the <hi rend="italic">a rationibus</hi>. From this
time the princeps ceased to hold himself accountable for the expenditure
of the public imperial revenues, and the <hi rend="italic">fiscus</hi> assumes an
independent position alongside of the old <hi rend="italic">aerarium</hi> of the Roman
people, which, as we have shown, it ultimately deprived of all share
in the control of the public finances. However, the distinction between
the public and private revenues of the princeps was still
observed, and the <hi rend="italic">patrimonium</hi> was independently administered by a
special procurator.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">(II). The Patrimonium.</hi> But with the extinction of the Julio-Claudian
house and the accession of Vespasian the patrimony of the
Caesars passed as an appendage of the principate to the new ruler.
It then became state property, and as it had grown to enormous size
owing to the inheritances of Augustus and the confiscations of Caligula
<pb n="272"/><anchor id="Pg272"/>and Nero, the <hi rend="italic">patrimonium</hi> was organized as an independent branch
of the imperial financial administration. The personal estate of the
princeps was henceforth distinguished as the <hi rend="italic">patrimonium privatum</hi>.
This situation continued until the accession of Septimius Severus,
whose enormous confiscations of the property of the adherents of
Niger and Albinus were incorporated in his personal estate. This,
the <hi rend="italic">patrimonium privatum</hi>, was now placed under a new department
of the public administration called the <hi rend="italic">ratio</hi> or <hi rend="italic">res privata</hi>. The old
<hi rend="italic">patrimonium</hi> became a subordinate branch of the <hi rend="italic">fiscus</hi>. The title
of the secretary of the treasury in charge of the <hi rend="italic">fiscus</hi> was now
changed to that of <hi rend="italic">rationalis</hi>, while the new secretary in charge of
    the privy purse was called at first <hi rend="italic">procurator</hi>, and later <hi rend="italic">magister</hi>, <hi rend="italic">rei
privatae</hi>. The reform of Severus, which gave to the private income
of the princeps a status in the administration comparable to that of
the public revenues, is a further expression of the monarchical tendencies
of his rule.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The officiales.</hi> The subaltern personnel of the various bureaus,
the clerks, accountants, etc., during the first two centuries of the
principate was composed almost entirely of imperial freedmen and
slaves. Among these there was apparently no fixed order of promotion
or uniform system of pay, nor could they ever advance to the
higher ranks of the service. However, from the time of Severus
soldiers began to be employed in these capacities and a military
organization was introduced into the bureaus. The way was thus
gradually paved for completely dispensing with the services of freedmen
and slaves in any part of the civil administration.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. The Army and the Defence of the Frontiers</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The barbarization of the army.</hi> It will be recalled that the
military policy of Augustus aimed at securing the supremacy of the
Roman element in the empire by restricting admission to the legions
to Roman citizens or to freeborn inhabitants of provincial municipalities
who received a grant of citizenship upon entering the service.
The gradual abandonment of this policy is one of the most significant
facts in the military history of the principate.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The territorial recruitment of the legions.</hi> Under the Augustan
system the legions in the West were recruited from Italy and the
romanized provinces of the West, the eastern legions from the Greek
<pb n="273"/><anchor id="Pg273"/>East and Galatia. But the increasing reluctance of the Italians to
render military service led to the practical, although not to the
theoretical, exemption of Italy from this burden which now rested
more heavily upon the latinized provinces. An innovation of utmost
importance was the introduction of the principle of territorial recruitment
for the legions by Hadrian. Henceforth these corps were recruited
principally from the provinces in which they were stationed,
and consequently freedom from the levy was extended to the ungarrisoned
provinces, Baetica, Narbonese Gaul, Achaia and Asia. The
effect of Hadrian’s reform is well illustrated by a comparison of the
various racial elements in the legions stationed in Egypt under the
early principate with those in the same legions in the time of Marcus
Aurelius. The lists of the veterans discharged from these legions
under Augustus or Tiberius show that fifty per cent were recruited
from Galatia, twenty-five per cent from the Greek municipalities in
Egypt, fifteen per cent from Syria and the Greek East, and the remainder
from the western provinces. A similar list from 168 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
shows sixty-five per cent from Egypt, the remainder from the Greek
East, and none from Galatia or the West. In general, the consequence
of Hadrian’s policy was to displace gradually in the legions
the more cultured element by the more warlike, but less civilized,
population from the frontiers of the provinces. It was Hadrian
also who opened the pretorian guard to provincials from Spain,
Noricum and Macedonia. As we have seen, Severus recruited the
pretorians from the legions and so deprived the more thoroughly
latinized parts of the empire of any real representation in the ranks
of the army.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The auxiliaries.</hi> The auxiliary corps, unlike the legions, were
not raised by Augustus from Roman citizens but from the non-Roman
provincials and allies. At first they were recruited and stationed
in their native provinces, but after the revolt of the Batavi in 68 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
they were regularly quartered along distant frontiers. From the time
of Hadrian, they were generally recruited, in the same manner as the
legions, from the districts in which they were in garrison. The extension
of Roman citizenship to practically the whole Roman world
by Caracalla in 212 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> removed the basic distinction between the
legions and the auxiliaries.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The numeri.</hi> A new and completely barbarous element was introduced
by Hadrian into the Roman army by the organization of the
<pb n="274"/><anchor id="Pg274"/>so-called <hi rend="italic">numeri</hi>, corps of varying size, recruited from the non-Romanized
peoples on the frontiers, who retained their local language,
weapons and methods of warfare but were commanded by Roman
prefects. The conquered German peoples settled on Roman soil by
Marcus Aurelius and his successors supplied contingents of this sort.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The strength of the army.</hi> At the death of Augustus the number
of the legions was twenty-five; under Vespasian it was thirty;
and Severus increased it to thirty-three, totalling over 180,000 men.
A corresponding increase had been made in the numbers of the
auxiliaries. From about 150,000 in the time of Augustus they had
increased to about 220,000 in the second century. The total number
of troops in the Roman service at the opening of the third century
was therefore about 400,000; one of the largest professional armies
the world has ever seen.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The system of frontier defence.</hi> A second momentous fact in
the military history of the principate was the transformation of the
army from a field force into garrison troops. This was the result
of the system developed for the defence of the frontiers. Augustus,
for the first time in the history of the Roman state endeavored to preclude
the possibility of indefinite expansion by attaining a frontier
protected by natural barriers beyond which the Roman power should
not be extended. Roughly speaking these natural defences of the
empire were the ocean on the west, the Rhine and the Danube on the
north, and the desert on the east and south. At strategic points behind
this frontier Augustus stationed his troops in large fortified
camps, in which both legionaries and auxiliaries were quartered.
These camps served as bases of operations and from them military
roads were constructed to advantageous points on the frontier itself to
permit the rapid movement of troops for offensive or defensive purposes.
Such roads were called <hi rend="italic">limites</hi> or <q>boundary paths,</q> a name
which subsequently was used in the sense of frontiers. These <hi rend="italic">limites</hi>
were protected by small forts manned by auxiliary troops.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The fortification of the limites.</hi> Although Claudius and Vespasian
discarded the maxims of Augustus in favor of an aggressive
border policy they adhered to his system for protecting their new
acquisitions in Britain and the Agri Decumates. However, these conquests
and that of the Wetterau region by Domitian pushed the frontier
beyond the line of natural defences and led to the attempt to construct
an artificial barrier as a substitute. It was Domitian who took
<pb n="275"/><anchor id="Pg275"/>the initial step in this direction by fortifying the <hi rend="italic">limites</hi> between the
Rhine and Main, and the Main and the Neckar, with a chain of small
earthen forts connected by a line of wooden watchtowers. To the
rear of this advanced line there were placed larger stone forts, each
garrisoned by a corps of auxiliaries, and connected by roads to the
posts on the border. While the auxiliary troops were thus distributed
along the frontiers in small detachments, the larger legionary cantonments
were broken up, and after 89 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> no camp regularly contained
more than a single legion. Trajan, who also waged his frontier wars
offensively, merely improved the system of communication between the
border provinces by building military highways along the line of the
frontier from the Rhine to the Black Sea, in Arabia, and in Africa.
</p>

<p>
In the matter of frontier defence, as in so many other spheres, a
new epoch begins with Hadrian. He reverted abruptly to the defensive
policy of Augustus and began to fortify the <hi rend="italic">limites</hi> on a more
elaborate scale. The frontier between the Rhine and the Danube was
protected by an unbroken line of ditch and palisade, in which stone
forts, each large enough for an auxiliary cohort, took the place of the
earthen forts of Domitian. At the same time the <hi rend="italic">limes</hi> was shortened
and straightened, and the secondary line of forts abandoned.
In Britain a wall of turf was constructed from the Tyne to the Solway,
and in the Dobrudja a similar wall linked the Danube to the Black
Sea. The eastern frontier of Dacia was likewise defended by a line
of fortifications. Here, as on the other borders, the Roman sphere of
influence, and even of military occupation, extended beyond the fortified
<hi rend="italic">limes</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Antonius Pius followed Hadrian’s example and ran an earthen
rampart with forts at intervals from the Forth to the Clyde in northern
Britain. This line of defence was abandoned by Septimius
Severus, who rebuilt Hadrian’s rampart in the form of a stone wall
with small forts at intervals of a mile and intervening watch towers.
In addition seventeen larger forts were constructed along the line of
the wall. The <hi rend="italic">limes</hi> in Germany was strengthened by the addition of
a ditch and earthen wall behind Hadrian’s palisade, but along the
so-called Raetian <hi rend="italic">limes</hi>, between the Danube and the Main, another
stone wall, 110 miles long, took the place of the earlier defences. A
similar change was made in the fortifications of the Dobrudja. However,
this system was not followed out in the East or in Africa, where
the <hi rend="italic">limes</hi> was guarded merely by a chain of blockhouses.
</p>

<pb n="276"/><anchor id="Pg276"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The consequences of permanent fortifications.</hi> The result of
the construction of permanent fortifications along the frontier was the
complete immobilization of the auxiliary corps. Stationed continuously
as they were for the most part in the same sectors from early in
the second century, and recruited, in increasing proportion, from among
the children of the camps, it only required the granting to them of
frontier lands by Severus Alexander, upon condition of their defending
them, to complete their transformation into a border militia
(<hi rend="italic">limitanei</hi>). At the same time the scattering of the legions along the
line of the frontiers made the assembling of any adequate mobile force
a matter of considerable time. And the fortifications themselves,
while useful in checking predatory raids by isolated bands and in
regulating intercourse across the frontiers, proved incapable of preventing
the invasion of larger forces. Consequently, when in the third
century the barbarians broke through the <hi rend="italic">limites</hi> they found no forces
capable of checking them until they had penetrated deeply into the
heart of the provinces.
</p>

<p>
The chaos which followed the death of Severus Alexander was the
result of a military policy which left the richest and most highly
civilized parts of the empire without any means of self-defence; created
a huge professional army the rank and file of which had come to
lose all contact with the ungarrisoned provinces, all interest in the
maintenance of an orderly government and all respect for civil authority;
and at the same time rendered the army itself incapable of
performing the task for which it was organized.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand the army had been one of the most influential
agents in the spread of the material and cultural aspects of Roman
civilization. The great highways of the empire, bridges, fortifications
and numerous public works of other sorts were constructed by
the soldiers. Every camp was a center for the spread of the Latin
language and Roman institutions and the number of Roman citizens
was being augmented continuously by the stream of discharged
auxiliaries whose term of service had expired. In the <hi rend="italic">canabae</hi>, or
villages of the civilian hangers-on of the army corps, sprang up organized
communities of Roman veterans with all the institutions and
material advantages of municipal life. The constant movement of
troops from one quarter of the empire to another furnished a ready
medium for the exchange of cultural, in particular of religious, ideas.
To the ideal of the empire the army remained loyal throughout the
<pb n="277"/><anchor id="Pg277"/>principate, although this loyalty came at length to be interpreted in
the light of its own particular interests. Not only was the army the
support of the power of the princeps; it was also the mainstay of the
<hi rend="italic">pax Romana</hi> which endured with two brief interruptions from the
battle of Actium to the death of Severus Alexander and was the
necessary condition for the civilizing mission of Rome.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">IV. The Provinces under the Principate</hi></head>

<p>
It is to the provinces that one must turn to win a true appreciation
of the beneficial aspects of Roman government during the principate.
As Mommsen<note place="foot"><hi rend="italic">Provinces of the Roman Empire</hi>, I, 5, trans. Dickson, Scribner’s, 1906.</note> has said: <q>It is in the agricultural towns of Africa,
in the homes of the vine-dressers on the Moselle, in the flourishing
townships of the Lycian mountains, and on the margin of the Syrian
desert that the work of the imperial period is to be sought and found.</q>
In this sphere the chief tasks of the principate were the correction of
the abuses of the republican administration and the extension of
Graeco-Roman civilization over the barbarian provinces of the west
and north. How well this latter work was done is attested not merely
by the material remains of once flourishing communities but also by
the extent to which the civilization of Western Europe rests upon the
basis of Roman culture.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Number of the provinces.</hi> At the establishment of the principate
there were about thirteen provinces, at the death of Augustus twenty-eight,
and under Hadrian forty-five. In the course of the third century
the latter number was considerably increased. The new provinces
were formed partly by the organization of newly conquered
countries as separate administrative districts and partly by the subdivision
of larger units. At times this subdivision was made in
order to relieve a governor of an excessively heavy task and to improve
the administration, and at times it proceeded from a desire to lessen
the dangers of a revolt of the army by breaking up the larger military
commands.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Senatorial and imperial provinces.</hi> As we have seen the provinces
were divided into two classes, senatorial or public and imperial
or Caesarian, corresponding to the division of administrative authority
between the Senate and the princeps. The general principle laid
<pb n="278"/><anchor id="Pg278"/>down by Augustus that the garrisoned provinces should come under
the authority of the princeps was adhered to, and consequently certain
provinces were at times taken over by the latter in view of military
necessities while others were given up by him to the Senate. As
a rule newly organized provinces were placed under imperial governors,
so that these soon came to outnumber the appointees of the Senate.
Eventually, as has been observed in connection with the history
of the civil service, the public provinces passed completely into the
hands of the princeps.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Administrative officials.</hi> The governors of the senatorial provinces
were entitled proconsuls, even if they were of pretorian rank.
However, Asia and Africa were reserved for ex-consuls. Following
the law of Pompey, a period of five years intervened between the
holding of a magistracy and a promagisterial appointment. Each
proconsul was assisted by a <hi rend="italic">quaestor</hi>, and by three propraetorian
<hi rend="italic">legati</hi> whose appointment was approved by the princeps. The imperial
governors were of two classes, <hi rend="italic">legati Augusti</hi> and procurators.
In the time of Hadrian there were eleven proconsuls, twenty-four
<hi rend="italic">legati Augusti</hi> and nine procurators, besides the prefect of Egypt.
The subordinates of the <hi rend="italic">legati Augusti</hi> were the legates in command
of the legions, and the fiscal procurators. The procuratorial governors,
at first called prefects, were equestrians, and were placed in command
of military districts of lesser importance which were garrisoned
by auxiliaries only. An exception to this practice was made in the
case of Egypt, which senators were forbidden to enter, and which was
governed by a prefect who ranked next to the praetorian prefect and
had under his orders a garrison of three legions. These governmental
procurators had, in addition to their military duties, the task of
supervising financial administration. The title <hi rend="italic">praeses</hi> (plural <hi rend="italic">praesides</hi>)
which was used in the second century for the imperial governors
of senatorial rank, came to designate the equestrian governors
when these supplanted the <hi rend="italic">legati</hi> in the latter half of the third century.
</p>

<p>
As under the republic, the governors exercised administrative, judicial,
and, in the imperial provinces, military authority. However,
with the advent of the principate the government of the empire aimed
to secure the welfare and not the spoliation of its subjects, and hence
a new era dawned for the provinces. All the governors now received
fixed salaries and thus one of their chief temptations to abuse their
power was removed. Oppressive governors were still to be found, but
<pb n="279"/><anchor id="Pg279"/>they were readily brought to justice—the senatorial governors before
the Senate and the imperial before the princeps—and condemnations,
not acquittals, were the rule. It was from the exactions of the imperial
fiscal procurators rather than those of the governors that the
provinces suffered under the principate. Although the term of the
senatorial governors, as before, was limited to one year, tried imperial
appointees were frequently kept at their posts for a number of
years in the interests of good government.
</p>

<p>
It has been mentioned before that under Augustus the taxation of
the provinces was revised to correspond more closely to their taxpaying
capacity. Under the principate these taxes were of two kinds,
direct or <hi rend="italic">tributa</hi> and indirect or <hi rend="italic">vectigalia</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">tributa</hi>, consisted of
a poll-tax (<hi rend="italic">tributum capitis</hi>), payable by all who had not Roman or
Latin citizenship, and a land and property tax (<hi rend="italic">tributum soli</hi>), from
which only communities whose land was granted the status of Italian
soil (<hi rend="italic">ius Italicum</hi>) were exempt. The chief indirect taxes were the
customs dues (<hi rend="italic">portoria</hi>), the five per cent tax on the value of emancipated
slaves, possibly the one per cent tax on sales, and the five per
cent inheritance tax which was levied on Roman citizens only. In
the imperial provinces the land tax was a fixed proportion of the
annual yield of the soil, whereas in the senatorial provinces it was
a definite sum (<hi rend="italic">stipendium</hi>) annually fixed for each community.
</p>

<p>
The principate did not break abruptly with the republican practice
of employing associations of <hi rend="italic">publicani</hi> in collecting the public
revenues. It is true that they had been excluded from Asia by Julius
Caesar, and it is possible that Augustus dispensed with them for the
raising of the direct taxes in the imperial provinces, but even in the
time of Tiberius they seem to have been active in connection with the
<hi rend="italic">tributa</hi> in some of the senatorial provinces. Their place in the imperial
provinces was taken by the procurator and his agents, in the
senatorial at first by the proconsul assisted by the taxpaying communities
themselves and later by imperial officials.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand the indirect taxes long continued to be raised
exclusively by the corporations of tax collectors in all the provinces.
However, the operations of these <hi rend="italic">publicani</hi> were strictly supervised
by the imperial procurators. In place of the previous custom of
paying a fixed sum to the state in return for which they acquired a
right to the total returns from the taxes in question, the <hi rend="italic">publicani</hi> now
received a fixed percentage of the amount actually collected. Under
<pb n="280"/><anchor id="Pg280"/>Hadrian the companies of <hi rend="italic">publicani</hi> engaged in collecting the customs
dues began to be superseded by individual contractors (<hi rend="italic">conductores</hi>),
who like the companies received a definite proportion of the amount
raised. About the time of Commodus the system of direct collection
by public officials was introduced and the contractors gave way to
imperial procurators. In the same way, the five percent taxes on
inheritances and manumissions were at first farmed out, but later
(under Hadrian in the case of the former) collected directly by agents
of the state.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The municipalities.</hi> Each province was an aggregate of communes
(<hi rend="italic">civitates</hi>), some of which were organized towns, while others
were tribal or village communities. From the opening of the principate
it became a fixed principle of imperial policy to convert the
rural communities into organized municipalities, which would assume
the burden of local administration. Under the Republic the provincial
communities had been grouped into the three classes, free and
federate (<hi rend="italic">liberae et foederatae</hi>), free and immune (<hi rend="italic">liberae et immunes</hi>),
and tributary (<hi rend="italic">stipendiariae</hi>). In addition to these native
communities there had begun to appear in the provinces Roman and
Latin colonies. Towards the close of the Republic and in the early
principate the majority of the free communities lost their immunity
from taxation and became tributary. Some of them exchanged the
status of federate allies of Rome for that of Roman colonies. During
the same period the number of colonies of both types was greatly
increased by the founding of new settlements or the planting of
colonists in provincial towns. Some of the latter also acquired the
status of Roman municipalities. Thus arose a great variety of provincial
communities, which is well illustrated by conditions in the
Spanish province of Baetica (Farther Spain) under Vespasian. At
that time this province contained nine colonies and eight municipalities
of Roman citizens; twenty-nine Latin towns; six free, three federate,
and one hundred and twenty tributary communities.
</p>

<p>
We have already mentioned the policy of transforming rural communities
into organized municipalities. How rapidly this transformation
took place may be gathered from the fact that in Tarraconesis
(Hither Spain) the number of rural districts sunk from one hundred
and fourteen to twenty-seven between the time of Vespasian and that
of Hadrian. A parallel movement was the conversion of the native
towns into Roman colonies and municipalities, often through the
<pb n="281"/><anchor id="Pg281"/>transitional stage of Latin communities, a status that now existed in
the provinces only. The acquirement of Roman or Latin status
brought exemption from the poll-tax, while the former opened the
way to all the civil and military offices of the empire. An added
advantage was won with the charter of a Roman colony, for this
usually involved immunity from the land tax also. The last step in
the Romanization of the provincial towns was Caracalla’s edict of
212 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> which conferred Roman citizenship upon all non-Roman
municipalities throughout the empire.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The three Gauls and Egypt.</hi> From this municipalization of the
provinces two districts were at first excluded on grounds of public
policy. These districts were the three Gauls (Aquitania, Lugdunensis
and Belgica) and Egypt. At the time of its conquest Gaul was a
rich agricultural country, with sharply defined tribal communities,
but little or no city development. This condition Augustus judged
well adapted, under strict imperial control, to furnishing recruits and
supplies of money and kind for the great army of the Rhine. Therefore
he continued the division of Gaul in tribal units (<hi rend="italic">civitates</hi>),
sixty-four in number, each controlled by its native nobility. His
policy was in general adhered to for about two hundred years, but
in the course of the third century the municipal system was introduced
by converting the chief town of each <hi rend="italic">civitas</hi> into a municipality
with the rest of the <hi rend="italic">civitas</hi> as its <hi rend="italic">territorium</hi> or district under
its administrative control.
</p>

<p>
In Egypt Augustus by right of conquest was the heir of the
Ptolemies and was recognized by the Egyptians proper as <q>king of
upper Egypt and king of lower Egypt, lord of the two lands, <hi rend="italic">autocrator</hi>,
son of the Sun.</q> For the Greek residents he was an absolute
deified ruler of the Hellenistic type. Thus Egypt, although a part
of the Roman empire, was looked upon as subject to the rule of
the princeps alone. And, as in the theory of government, so in
the political institutions of the country the Romans adapted to
their purposes existing conditions in place of introducing radical
changes.
</p>

<p>
In the time of Augustus there were three Greek towns in Egypt,
Alexandria the capital, Ptolemais and Naucratis. To these Hadrian
added a third, Antinoopolis. Ptolemais, Naucratis and Antinoopolis
enjoyed municipal institutions, but Alexandria because of the turbulence
of its population was ruled by imperial officials following the
<pb n="282"/><anchor id="Pg282"/>Ptolemaic practice. The rest of the population of the country lived
in villages throughout the Nile Valley, which was divided for administrative
purposes into thirty-six districts called nomes (<hi rend="italic">nomoi</hi>).
The bulk of the land of Egypt was imperial or public domain land,
and the great majority of the Egyptian population were tenants on the
imperial domain. For the collection of the land tax, poll tax, professional
and other taxes, for the supervision of irrigation, and for
the maintenance of the public records of the cultivated acreage and
the population (for which a census was taken every fourteen years)
there had been developed a highly organized bureaucracy with central
offices at Alexandria and agents in each of the nomes. This system
of government was maintained by the Romans, and profoundly influenced
the organization of the imperial civil service. At the head of
the administration of Egypt stood the prefect, an equestrian because
of his position as a personal employee of the princeps, and because
the power concentrated in his hands would have proved a dangerous
temptation to a senator. The chief burden laid upon Egypt was to
supply one third of the grain consumed at Rome, or about 5,000,000
bushels annually. This amount was drawn partly from the land tax
which was paid in kind and partly from grain purchased by the
government.
</p>

<p>
The first step towards spreading municipal government throughout
all Egypt was taken in 202 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, when Septimius Severus organized
a <hi rend="italic">boule</hi>, or senate of the Greek type, in Alexandria and in the metropolis
or seat of administration of each nome. His object was to
create in each metropolis a body which could be made to assume definite
responsibilities in connection with the administration. However,
it was not until after Diocletian that these villages received a
full municipal organization.
</p>

<p>
The principate’s greatest service to the provinces was the gift of
two and a half centuries of orderly government, which led in many
quarters to a material development unequalled in these regions before
or since. It is in these centuries that the history of Rome becomes
the history of the provinces. At the opening of the period the Italians
occupied a privileged position within the empire, at its close they and
their one-time subjects were on the same level. The army and the
senatorial and equestrian orders had been thoroughly provincialized,
and the emperors had come to be as a rule of provincial birth. Rome
was still the seat of the administration, but this and the corn dole to
<pb n="283"/><anchor id="Pg283"/>the city proletariat were the only things that distinguished it from a
provincial city.
</p>

<p>
The imperial government of Rome had crushed out all vestiges of
national loyalty among the peoples it had absorbed, and had failed
to create any political institutions which would have permitted the
provincials, as such, to have participated in the government of the
empire. With the gradual decline of municipal autonomy the great
mass of the provincials were deprived of the last traces of an independent
political life. The provincial councils established for the
maintenance of the imperial cult did indeed occasionally voice the
complaints of the provincials but never acquired active political powers.
And that the Roman administration proved a heavy burden is
attested by the numerous complaints against the weight of taxation
and the necessity which many emperors felt of remitting the arrears
of tribute.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">V. Municipal Life</hi></head>

<p>
The Roman empire was at bottom an aggregate of locally self-governing
communities, which served as units for conscription, taxation
and jurisdiction. They were held together by the army and
the civil service, and were united by the bonds of a common Graeco-Roman
civilization. These municipalities were of two general types,
the Hellenic in the East and the Latin in the West.
</p>

<p>
The Hellenic municipalities were developments from the <hi rend="italic">poleis</hi>, or
city-states, which existed prior to the Roman conquest in Greece and
the Hellenized areas of Asia and Africa. Municipal towns organized
in these areas subsequent to the Roman occupation were of the same
type. Their language of government, as well as of general intercourse,
was Greek. The characteristic political institutions of the Hellenic
municipalities were a popular assembly, a council or <hi rend="italic">boule</hi> and annual
magistrates. The assembly had the power to initiate legislation;
the council and magistrates were elected by it or were chosen by lot.
But even under the Roman republic these democratic institutions
were considerably modified in the interests of the wealthier classes.
Timocratic constitutions were established with required property qualifications
for citizenship and for the council and offices. The principate
saw a further development along the same lines. The assemblies
lost their right to initiate legislation, a power which passed to
the magistrates, while the council tended to become a body of
ex-<pb n="284"/><anchor id="Pg284"/>magistrates who held their seats for life. However, in spite of this
approximation to the Latin type, the Greek official terminology remained
unchanged throughout the first three centuries <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Latin type of municipality was that which developed on Italian
soil with the extension of Roman domination over the peninsula, and
which was given uniformity by the legislation of Julius Caesar.
With the Romanization of the western part of the empire it spread
to Africa, Spain, Gaul, Britain, Germany and the Danubian provinces.
In spite of the distinctions in status between Roman and
Latin colonies and <hi rend="italic">municipia</hi>, all these classes of municipalities were
of the same general type which is revealed to us in the Julian Municipal
Law (45 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>), the charter of the Roman <hi rend="italic">Colonia Genetiva
Julia</hi> (44 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>), and those of the Latin municipalities of Malaca and
Salpensa (81–84 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
The constitutions of these municipalities were patterned closely
after that of Rome, although certain titles, like those of consul and
Senate were reserved for the capital city. Like Rome, the municipal
towns had their officials, their council (<hi rend="italic">curia</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ordo</hi>), and their plebs.
The chief magistrates were a pair of duovirs (or at times a college of
quattuovirs), who were assisted by two aediles, and two quaestors
The duovirs were in charge of the local administration of justice, and
in general conducted the public affairs of the community. Every
fifth year the duovirs were called <hi rend="italic">quinquennales</hi> and took the census.
The aediles had charge of public works, and market and police regulations,
while the quaestors were the local treasury officials. All the
officials were elected by popular vote, but a definite property qualification
was required of each candidate. If no candidates presented
themselves for any particular office, provision was made for the nomination
of candidates who must serve if elected. At his election each
magistrate paid into the treasury, or expended in accordance with the
direction of the council, a definite sum of money (<hi rend="italic">summa honoraria</hi>),
which varied for each office in different communities. Oftentimes
these officers did not restrict themselves to the required sum but took
this opportunity for displaying their municipal loyalty. As other
prominent citizens followed their example the municipalities were
richly provided with useful and ornamental public works donated by
the richer classes. Thus the municipal offices, being unsalaried,
were a heavy drain upon the resources of their holders, but at the
same time they offered almost the sole opportunity for gratifying the
<pb n="285"/><anchor id="Pg285"/>political ambitions of the population of the provinces. In addition
to these civil officials, each community had its colleges of pontiffs and
augurs.
</p>

<p>
The members of the <hi rend="italic">curia</hi> were called <hi rend="italic">decuriones</hi>, and were usually
one hundred in number. They comprised those who had held some
local magistracy, and others having the requisite property qualification
who were enrolled directly (<hi rend="italic">adlecti</hi>) in the council. The council
supervised the work of the magistrates and really directed the municipal
administration. As in early Rome, so in the municipalities
the people were grouped in <hi rend="italic">curiae</hi>, which were the voting units in
the local assembly or <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi>. This assembly elected the magistrates
and had legislative powers corresponding to those of the Roman assemblies.
However, in the course of the second century <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> these
legislative powers passed into the hands of the council, whose decrees
became the sole form of municipal legislation.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The collegia.</hi> While the plebs of Rome and the municipalities
alike had little opportunity for political activity they found a compensation
in the social life of their guilds or colleges. These were
associations of persons who had some common tie, such as a common
trade or profession, a common worship, or the humble desire to secure
for themselves a decent burial by mutual coöperation. Thus
arose professional, religious, and funerary colleges. The organization
of the colleges was modelled on that of the municipalities. They
had their patrons, their presidents (<hi rend="italic">magistri</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">quinquennales</hi>),
their quaestors, and their treasury sustained by initiation fees,
monthly dues, fines, contributions, gifts and legacies. The membership
was called plebs or <hi rend="italic">populus</hi>. The chief factor in the life of the
colleges was the social element and their most important gatherings
were for the purpose of holding a common banquet. The professional
colleges in no way corresponded to the modern trades unions;
they attempted no collective bargaining with regard to wages, prices or
working hours, although they did not altogether neglect the common
interests of their profession.
</p>

<p>
Apparently until late republican times no restrictions had been
placed upon the forming of such collegiate associations, but in 64 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>
all such unions in Rome had been abolished because of the disorders
occasioned by political clubs. In 58 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> complete freedom of association
was restored, only to be revoked again by Julius Caesar
who permitted only the old and reputable professional and religious
<pb n="286"/><anchor id="Pg286"/>colleges to remain in existence. Under Augustus a law was passed
which regulated for the future the character, organization and activities
of these associations. New colleges could only be established
in Italy or the provinces if sanctioned by a decree of the Senate or
edict of the princeps, and membership in an unauthorized college was
a treasonable offence. Trajan authorized the unrestricted formation
of funerary colleges (<hi rend="italic">collegia tenuiorum</hi>) in Rome, and Septimius
Severus extended this privilege to Italy and the provinces. Under
Marcus Aurelius the colleges were recognized as juristic persons, with
power to manumit slaves and receive legacies. Not only persons of
free birth but also freedmen and slaves, and in many cases women as
well as men, were freely admitted to membership in the colleges.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The decline of the municipalities.</hi> The prosperity of the empire
depended upon the prosperity of the municipalities and it is in
the latter that the first symptoms of internal decay are noticeable.
These symptoms were economic decline and the consequent loss of
local autonomy. The reasons for the economic decline are hard to
trace. Among them we may perhaps place the ruin of many of the
wealthier families by the requirements of office-holding, the withdrawal
of others who were eligible for the imperial service with its
salaried offices; overtaxation, bad management of local finances, and
the disappearance of a free peasantry in the surrounding rural districts
who had furnished a market for the manufacturers and merchants
of the towns. The devastating wars of the third century with
the resultant general paralysis of trade and commerce, plus the depopulation
caused by plague and barbarian invasions, struck the municipalities
a crushing blow from which they never recovered.
</p>

<p>
As early as the time of Trajan the imperial government found it
necessary to appoint officials called curators to reorganize the financial
conditions in one or more municipalities, sometimes those of a
whole province. At first these were irregular officials, senators or
equestrians, but by the third century they had become a fixture in municipal
administration and were chosen from among the local <hi rend="italic">decuriones</hi>.
Another evidence of the same conditions is the change
which took place in the position of the local magistracies. In the
second century these offices were still an honor for which candidates
voluntarily presented themselves, although there were unmistakable
signs that in some districts they were coming to be regarded as a
burden. In the third century the magistracies had become an
obli<pb n="287"/><anchor id="Pg287"/>gation resting upon the local senatorial order, and to which appointments
were made by the <hi rend="italic">curia</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">decurionate</hi> also had become a
burden which all who possessed a definite census rating must assume.
To assure itself of its revenues in view of the declining prosperity
of the communities the imperial government had hit upon the expedient
of making the local decurions responsible for collecting the
taxes, and consequently had been forced to make the decurionate an
obligatory status. The <hi rend="italic">curia</hi> and municipal magistracies had ended
by becoming unwilling cogs in the imperial financial administration.
</p>

<p>
This loss of municipal independence was accompanied by the conversion
of the voluntary professional colleges into compulsory public
service corporations. From the opening of the principate the government
had depended largely upon private initiative for the performance
of many necessary services in connection with the provisioning
of the city of Rome, a task which became increasingly complicated
when the state undertook the distribution of oil under Septimius
Severus, of bread in place of grain and of cheap wine under Aurelian.
Therefore such colleges as the shipowners (<hi rend="italic">navicularii</hi>), bakers
(<hi rend="italic">pistores</hi>), pork merchants (<hi rend="italic">suarii</hi>), wine merchants (<hi rend="italic">vinarii</hi>), and
oil merchants (<hi rend="italic">olerarii</hi>) received official encouragement. Their members
individually assumed public contracts and in course of time
came to receive certain privileges because it was recognized that they
were performing services necessary to the public welfare. Marcus
Aurelius, Severus and Caracalla were among the emperors who thus
fostered the professional guilds. Gradually the idea developed that
these services were public duties (<hi rend="italic">munera</hi>) to which the several colleges
were obligated, and hence Severus Alexander took the initiative
in founding new colleges until all the city trades were thus organized.
The same princeps appointed judicial representatives from each guild
and placed them under the jurisdiction of definite courts. The colleges
from this time onward operated under governmental supervision
and really formed a part of the machinery of the administration, although
they had not yet become compulsory and hereditary organizations.
</p>

<p>
The history of the colleges in the municipalities paralleled that of
the Roman guilds, although it cannot be traced so clearly in detail.
The best known of the municipal colleges are those of the artificers
(<hi rend="italic">fabri</hi>), the makers of rag cloths (<hi rend="italic">centonarii</hi>), and the wood cutters
(<hi rend="italic">dendrophori</hi>). The organization of these colleges was everywhere
<pb n="288"/><anchor id="Pg288"/>encouraged because their members had the obligation of acting as a
local fire brigade, but in the exercise of their trades they were not in
the service of their respective communities.
</p>

<p>
It was in the latter part of the third century, when the whole fabric
of society seemed threatened with destruction, that the state, with the
object of maintaining organized industry and commerce, placed upon
the properties of the members of the various colleges in Rome and in
the municipalities the burden of maintaining the work of these corporations;
a burden which soon came also to be laid upon the individual
members thereof. In this way the plebeian class throughout
the empire sank to the status of laborers in the service of the state.
</p>
            </div><div>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">VI. The Colonate or Serfdom</hi></head>

<p>
While the municipal decurions, and the Roman and municipal
plebs had thus sunk to the position of fiscally exploited classes, the
bulk of the agricultural population of the empire had fallen into a
species of serfdom known to the Romans as the colonate, from the
use of the word <hi rend="italic">colonus</hi> to denote a tenant farmer. This condition
arose under varying circumstances in the different parts of the empire,
but its development in Italy and the West was much influenced
by the situation in some of the eastern provinces, where the peasantry
were in a state of quasi-serfdom prior to the Roman conquest.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Egypt.</hi> In Egypt under the Ptolemies the inhabitants of village
communities were compelled to perform personal services to the state,
including the cultivation of royal land not let out on contract, each
within the boundaries of the community in which he was registered
(his <hi rend="italic">idia</hi>). With the introduction of Roman rule this theory of the
<hi rend="italic">idia</hi> was given greater precision. All the land of each village had to
be tilled by the residents thereof, either as owners or tenants. At
times, indeed, the inhabitants of one village might be forced to cultivate
vacant lands at a distance. During the seasons of sowing and
harvest the presence of every villager was required in his <hi rend="italic">idia</hi>. The
crushing weight of taxation, added to the other obligations of the
peasantry caused many of them to flee from their <hi rend="italic">idia</hi>, and this led
to an increasing amount of unleased state land. As a large number
of private estates had developed, chiefly because of the encouragement
extended to those who brought waste land under cultivation, the government
forced the property holders to assume the contracts for the
<pb n="289"/><anchor id="Pg289"/>vacant public lands in their districts. With the introduction of the
municipal councils in the course of the third century, these were made
responsible for the collection of the taxes of each nome. To enable
the councillors, who were property holders, to fulfill this obligation,
their tenants were forbidden to leave their holdings. And so, as state
or private tenants, the peasants came to be bound to the soil.
</p>

<p>
The development in Asia Minor was similar. There the royal
lands of the Seleucids became the public land of Rome, and out of
this the Roman magnates of the later Republic developed vast estates
which in turn were concentrated in the hands of Augustus. These
imperial domains were cultivated by peasants, who lived in village
communities and paid a yearly rental for the land they occupied.
The rest of the land of Asia formed the territories dependent upon
the Greek cities, and was occupied by a native population who were
in part free peasants settled in villages. On the imperial domains
the village came to be the <hi rend="italic">idia</hi> to which the peasant was permanently
attached for the performance of his liturgies or obligatory services,
while on the municipal territories the agricultural population was
bound to the soil as tenants of the municipal landholders, the local
senators, upon whom had been placed the responsibility for the payment
of the taxes of their municipalities.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Africa.</hi> In Africa the transformation was effected differently.
There, at the opening of the principate, outside of the municipal territories,
the land fell into <hi rend="italic">ager publicus</hi>, private estates of Roman
senators and imperial domains. Under the early emperors, particularly
Nero, the bulk of the private estates passed by legacy and confiscation
into the control of the princeps, who also took over the administration
of the public domain in so far as it was not absorbed in
new municipal areas. This domain land was divided into large districts
(<hi rend="italic">tractus</hi>, <hi rend="italic">regiones</hi>) which were directly administered by imperial
procurators. Each district comprised a number of estates (<hi rend="italic">saltus</hi>,
<hi rend="italic">fundi</hi>). Whatever slave labor had at one time been used in African
<anchor id="corr289"/><corr sic="argricultural">agricultural</corr> operations was, by the early principate, largely displaced
by free laborers, called <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi>. These <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> were either Italian immigrants
or tributary native holders of the public land.
</p>

<p>
The estates were usually managed as follows. The procurators
leased them to tenant contractors (<hi rend="italic">conductores</hi>), who retained a part
of their lease holds under their own supervision, and sublet the remainder
to tenant farmers (<hi rend="italic">coloni</hi>). The relation of these <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> to
<pb n="290"/><anchor id="Pg290"/>the contractors as well as to the owners of private estates or their
bailiffs (<hi rend="italic">vilici</hi>), was regulated by an edict of a certain Mancia, apparently
a procurator under the Flavians. By this edict the <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi>
were obliged to pay a definite proportion of their crop as rental, and
in addition to render a certain number of days’ work, personally
and with their teams, on the land of the person from whom they held
their lease. The <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> comprised both landless residents on the estates
and small landholders from neighboring villages. They were
encouraged to occupy vacant domain land and bring it under cultivation.
Over plough land thus cultivated they obtained the right of
occupation for life, but orchard land became an hereditary possession,
while in both cases the occupant was required to pay rental in
kind to the state. Hadrian also tried to further the development of
peasant landholders by permitting the <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> to occupy any lands not
tilled by the middlemen, and giving them rights of possession over all
types of land. However, the forced services still remained and these
constituted the chief grievance of the <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi>. And here the government
was on the horns of a dilemma, for if the middlemen were restrained
from undue exactions often large areas remained untilled,
and if the <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> were oppressed they absconded and left their holdings
without tenants.
</p>

<p>
It was in the course of the third century that the failure to create
an adequate class of independent small farmers caused the state to fall
back upon the development of large private estates as the only way of
keeping the land under cultivation and maintaining the public revenues.
As a result of this change of policy the middlemen were transformed
from tenants into proprietors, and, like the landholders of
Egypt, they were forced to assume the lease of vacant public land
adjacent to their estates. But to make it possible for the proprietors
to fulfill this obligation the state had to give them control over the
labor needed to till the soil. Hence the <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> were forbidden to
leave the estates where they had once established themselves as
tenants. In Africa the estate became the <hi rend="italic">idia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">origo</hi> corresponding
to the village in Egypt. In the municipal territories the landholders
of the towns played the rôle of the middlemen on the imperial domains.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Italy.</hi> In Italy, unlike Africa, conditions upon the private, rather
than the imperial, domains determined the rise of the colonate. At
the close of the Republic the land of Italy was occupied by the
<pb n="291"/><anchor id="Pg291"/><hi rend="italic">latifundia</hi> and peasant holdings, the former of which were by far
the most important factor in agricultural life. It will be recalled
that the <hi rend="italic">latifundia</hi> were great plantations and ranches whose development
had been facilitated by an abundant supply of cheap slave
labor. However, even in the first century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> these plantations were
partly tilled by free peasants, either as tenants or day laborers, and
under the principate there was a gradual displacement of slaves by
free <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi>. The causes for this transformation lay in the cutting off
of the main supply of slaves through the suppression of the slave-trading
pirates and the cessation of aggressive foreign wars, the decrease
in the number of slaves through manumissions, the growth of
humanitarian tendencies which checked their ruthless exploitation,
and the realization that the employment of free labor was in the long
run more profitable than that of slaves, particularly when the latter
were becoming increasingly expensive to procure. The <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> worked
the estates of the landowners for a certain proportion of the harvest.
As elsewhere, in Italy it was fiscal necessity which converted the
free <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> into serfs. With the spread of waste lands, due partly
to a decline of the population, the state intervened on behalf of the
landlords as it had in the provinces and attached the peasants to the
domain where they had once been voluntary tenants. Elsewhere
throughout the empire, although the process cannot be traced in detail,
a similar transformation took place.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the ultimate responsibility for the development of the
colonate may rest upon the attempt of the imperial government to
incorporate within the empire vast territories in a comparatively low
state of civilization, and upon the fiscal system whereby it was designed
that the expenses imposed by this policy should be met. In
the West the administration strove to develop a strong class of prosperous
peasants as state tenants; in the East its object was to maintain
this class which was already in existence. But the financial
needs of the state caused such a heavy burden to be laid upon the
agricultural population that the ideal of a prosperous free peasantry
proved impossible of realization. The ravages of war and plague in
the second and third centuries also fell heavily upon the peasants. As
a last resource to check the decline of agriculture the government
placed the small farmer at the disposal of the rich landlord and made
him a serf. The results were oppression, poverty, lack of initiative,
a decline in the birth rate, flight and at the end an increase of
un<pb n="292"/><anchor id="Pg292"/>cultivated, unproductive land. The transplanting of conquered barbarians
within the empire swelled the class of the <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> but proved
only a partial palliative to the general shrinkage of the agricultural
elements. But the converse to the development of the colonate was
the creation of a powerful class of landholders who were the owners
of large domains exempt from the control of municipal authorities.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Imperial Rome.</hi> Roman society under the Principate exhibits in
general the same characteristics as during the last century of the
Republic. Rome itself was a thoroughly cosmopolitan city, where
the concentration of wealth and political power attracted the ambitious,
the adventurous and the curious from all lands. Whole
quarters were occupied by various nationalities, most prominent among
whom were the Greeks, the Syrians, and the Jews, speaking their own
languages and plying their native trades. With the freeborn foreign
population mingled the thousands of slaves and freedmen of every
race and tongue. During the first and second century the population
of Rome must have been in the neighborhood of one million, but in
the third century it began to decline as a result of pestilence and the
general bankruptcy of the empire. Inevitably in such a city there
were the sharpest contrasts between riches and poverty, and the
luxurious palaces of the wealthy were matched by the squalid tenements
of the proletariat. In outward appearance Rome underwent
a transformation which made her worthy to be capital of so vast an
empire. This was largely due to the great number of public buildings
erected by the various emperors and to the lavish employment of
marble in public and private architecture from the time of Augustus.
The temples, basilicas, fora, aqueducts, public baths, theatres, palaces,
triumphal arches, statues, and parks combined to arouse the enthusiastic
admiration of travelers and the pride of its inhabitants. But,
although after the great fire of 64 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> many improvements were
made in the plan of the city, restrictions placed upon the height of
buildings, and fireproof construction required for the lower stories,
still the streets remained narrow and dingy, the lofty tenements were
of flimsy construction, in perpetual danger of collapse, and devastating
conflagrations occurred periodically.
</p>

<pb n="294"/><anchor id="Pg294"/>

<p>
The task of feeding the city plebs and providing for their entertainment
was a ruinous legacy left by the Republic to the principate. Although
the number of recipients of free corn was not increased after
Augustus, the public spectacles became ever more numerous and more
magnificent. Under Tiberius eighty-seven days of the year were
regularly occupied by these entertainments but by the time of Marcus
Aurelius there were one hundred and thirty-five such holidays. In
addition came extraordinary festivals to celebrate special occasions,
like the one hundred and twenty-three day carnival given by Trajan
at his second Dacian triumph in 106 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> The spectacles were of
three main types; the chariot races in the circus, the gladiatorial combats
and animal baiting in the amphitheatre, and the dramatic and
other performances in the theatre. The expense of these celebrations
fell upon the senatorial order and the princeps. Indeed the most important
function of the consulship, praetorship and, until its disappearance
in the third century, the aedileship, came to be the celebration
of the regular festivals. The sums provided for such purposes
by the state were entirely inadequate and so the cost had to be
met largely from the magistrates’ private resources. The extraordinary
spectacles were all given at the expense of the princeps who also
at times granted subventions to favored senators from the imperial
purse. The cost of the public shows placed as heavy a drain upon
the fortunes of the senatorial order as did the <hi rend="italic">summa honoraria</hi> upon
the holders of municipal offices.
</p>

<p>
A new feature of Roman society under the principate was the
growth of the imperial court. In spite of the wishes of Augustus
and some of his successors to live on a footing of equality with the
rest of the nobility, it was inevitable that the exceptional political
power of the princeps should give a corresponding importance to his
household organization. Definite offices developed within the imperial
household not only for the conduct of public business but also
for the control of slaves and freedmen in the domestic service of the
princeps. The chief household officials were the chamberlain <hi rend="italic">a
cubiculo</hi> and the chief usher (<hi rend="italic">ab admissione</hi>). Because of their
intimate personal association with the princeps their influence over
him was very great, and as a rule they did not hesitate to use their
position to enrich themselves at the expense of those who sought the
imperial favor. From among the senators and equestrians the princeps
chose a number of intimate associates and advisors who were
<pb n="295"/><anchor id="Pg295"/>called his <q>friends.</q> When forming part of his cortege away from
Rome they were known as his companions (<hi rend="italic">comites Augusti</hi>). In
connection with the imperial audiences a certain degree of ceremonial
developed, with fixed forms of salutation which differentiated the
rank and station of those attending these functions. In the society
of the capital the personal tastes of the princeps set the fashion of
the day.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Clients.</hi> Characteristic of the times was the new form of clientage
which was a voluntary association of master and paid retainer.
Under the republic eminent men had throngs of adherents to greet
them at their morning reception and accompany them to the forum.
It had now become obligatory for practically every man of wealth
to maintain such a retinue, which should be at his beck and call at
all hours of the day and be prepared to serve him in various ways.
In return the patron helped to support his clients with fees, food, and
gifts of clothing, and rendered them other favors. The clients were
recruited partly from freedmen, partly from citizens of low birth, and
partly from persons of the better class who had fallen upon evil days.
In general the lot of these pensioners does not seem to have been a
very happy one—even the slaves of their patrons despised them—and
their large numbers are to be attributed to the superior attractions
of city over country life, and to the stigma which in Rome
rested upon industrial employment.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Slaves and freedmen.</hi> In the early principate slave-holding continued
on as large a scale as in the late republic. The palaces of
the wealthy in Rome could count slaves by hundreds; on the larger
plantations they were numbered by thousands. Trained slaves were
also employed in great numbers in various trades and industries.
Their treatment varied according to their employment and the character
of their owners, but there was a steady progress towards greater
humanitarianism, largely due to the influence of philosophic doctrines.
In the age of the Antonines this produced legislation which limited the
power of the master over his slave. As time went on the number of
slaves steadily diminished, in part because of the cessation of continual
foreign wars after the time of Augustus, in part because of the
great increase of manumissions. Not only were large numbers set
free at the death of their owners as a final act of generosity, but also
many found it profitable to liberate their slaves and provide them
with capital to engage in business for themselves. Many slaves also
<pb n="296"/><anchor id="Pg296"/>had good opportunities for accumulating a small store of money
(<hi rend="italic">peculium</hi>) with which they could purchase their freedom.
</p>

<p>
The result of these wholesale manumissions was a tremendous increase
in the freedmen class. Foreseeing the effect that this would
have upon the Roman citizen body, Augustus endeavored to restrict
the right of emancipation. By the <hi rend="italic">lex Fufia Caninia</hi> (2 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>) testamentary
manumissions were limited to a fixed proportion of the total
number of slaves held by the deceased, and not more than one hundred
allowed in any case. The <hi rend="italic">lex Aelia Sentia</hi> (4 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>) placed restrictions
upon the master’s right of manumission during his lifetime, and
the Junian law of about the same time prevented slaves liberated
without certain formalities from receiving Roman citizenship although
granting them the status of Latins. Even freedmen who became Romans
lacked the right of voting or of holding office in Rome or the
municipalities, unless they received from the princeps the right to
wear the gold ring which gave them the privileges of freeborn citizens.
In spite of these laws the number of the freedmen grew apace,
and there is no doubt that in the course of the principate the racial
characteristics of the population of Rome and of the whole peninsula
of Italy underwent a complete transformation as a result of the infusion
of this new element, combined with the emigration of Italians
to the provinces.
</p>

<p>
The importance of the rôle played by the freedmen in Roman
society was in proportion to their numbers. From them were recruited
the lower ranks of the civil service, they filled every trade and
profession, the commerce of the empire was largely in their hands,
they became the managers of estates and of business undertakings of
all sorts. The eager pursuit of money at all costs was their common
characteristic, and <q>freedman’s wealth</q> was a proverbial expression
for riches quickly acquired. The more successful of their class became
landholders in Italy and aped the life and manners of the nobility.
Their lack of good taste, so common to the <hi rend="italic">nouveaux riches</hi>
of all ages, afforded a good target for the jibes of satirists and is caricatured
in the novel of Petronius. We have already seen the influence
of the few among them who by the emperors’ favor attained positions
of political importance. Despise the freedmen though they
might, the Romans found them indispensable for the conduct of public
and private business.
</p>

<pb n="297"/><anchor id="Pg297"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Commerce and industry.</hi> The restoration of peace within the
empire, the suppression of piracy, the extension of the Roman military
highways throughout all the provinces, the establishment of a
single currency valid for the whole empire, and the low duties levied
at the provincial customs frontiers combined to produce an hitherto
unexampled development of commercial enterprise. Traders from
all parts of the provinces thronged the ports of Italy, and one merchant
of Hierapolis in Phrygia has left a record of his seventy-two
voyages there. But Roman commerce was not confined within the
Roman borders, it also flourished with outside peoples, particularly
those of the East. From the ports of Egypt on the Red Sea large
merchant fleets sailed for southern Arabia and India, while a brisk
caravan trade through the Parthian and Bactrian kingdoms brought
the silks of China to the Roman markets. Even the occasional presence
of Roman merchants in China is vouched for by Chinese records.
Among all the races of the empire the most active in these mercantile
ventures were the Syrians, whose presence may be traced not only in
the commercial centers of the East, but also in the harbors of Italy
and throughout all the western provinces.
</p>

<p>
The increased opportunities for trading stimulated the development
of manufacturing, for not only could raw materials be more easily
procured but towns favorably situated for the manufacture of particular
types of goods could find a wider market for their products.
However, industrial organization never attained a high degree of development.
In the production of certain wares, such as articles of
bronze, silver, glass, and, especially, pottery and bricks, the factory
system seems to have been employed, with a division of labor among
specialized artisans. In general, however, this was not the case and
each manufactured article was the product of one man’s labor. In
Italy, and probably throughout the western provinces, the bulk of the
work of this sort was done by slaves and freedmen.
</p>

<p>
At the same time the art of agriculture had been developed to a
very high degree, and Columella, an agricultural writer of the time
of Nero, shows a good knowledge of the principles of fertilization
and rotation of crops.
</p>

<p>
However, this material prosperity, which attained its height early
in the second century of our era, declined from reasons which have
already been described until the whole empire reached a state of
eco<pb n="298"/><anchor id="Pg298"/>nomic bankruptcy in the course of the third century. The progressive
bankruptcy of the government is shown by the steady deterioration
of the coinage. Under Nero the denarius, the standard silver coin,
was first debased. This debasement continued until under Septimius
Severus it became one half copper. Caracalla issued a new silver
coin, the Antoninianus, one and a half times the weight of the denarius
of the day. Both these coins rapidly deteriorated in quality
until they became mere copper coins with a wash of silver. Aurelian
made the first attempt to correct this evil by issuing only the Antoninianus
and giving this a standard value.
</p>

<p>
To pass a moral judgment upon society under the principate is a
difficult task. The society depicted in the satires of Juvenal and in
Martial, in the court gossip of Suetonius, or in the polemics of the
Christian writers seems hopelessly corrupt and vicious. But their
picture is not complete. The letters of Pliny reveal an entirely different
world with a high standard of human conduct, whose ideals are
expressed in the philosophic doctrines of Seneca and Marcus Aurelius.
And the funerary inscriptions from the municipalities, where life
was more wholesome and simple than in the large cities, pay a sincere
tribute to virtue in all its forms. The luxurious extravagance of imperial
Rome has been equalled and surpassed in more recent times,
and, apart from the vices of slavery and the arena, modern society has
little wherewith to reproach that of the principate.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. The Intellectual World</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Literature.</hi> The principate had two literatures; one Greek, the
other Roman. But the forms of literary production were the same
in each, and the Roman authors took rank with those of Greece in
their respective fields. For the Romans could boast that they had
adapted the Latin tongue to the literary types of the older culture
world, while preserving in their work a spirit genuinely Roman.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Augustan age.</hi> The feeling of relief produced by the cessation
of the civil wars, and the hopes engendered by the policy of
Augustus inspired a group of writers whose genius made the age of
Augustus the culminating point in the development of Roman poetry,
like the age of Cicero in Roman prose. Foremost among the poets
of the new era was Virgil (70–19 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>), the son of a small landholder
of Mantua, whose <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, a national epic, the glorification
<pb n="299"/><anchor id="Pg299"/>alike of Rome and of the Julian house, placed him with Homer in
the front rank of epic poets for all time. His greatest contemporary
was Horace (65–8 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>), the son of a freedman from South Italy.
It was Horace who first wrote Latin lyrics in the complicated meters
of Greece, and whose genial satire and insight into human nature
have combined with his remarkable happiness of phrase to make him
the delight of cultivated society both in antiquity and modern times.
The leading <anchor id="corr299"/><corr sic="elegaic">elegiac</corr> poets were Propertius, Tibullus and Ovid (43
<hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>–17 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). In his <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi> the latter recounted
with masterly narrative skill the legends of Greek and Roman
mythology. His elegies reveal the spirit of the pleasure-seeking society
of new Rome and show the ineffectiveness of the attempt of
Augustus to bring about a moral regeneration of the Roman people.
This, probably, was the true ground for his banishment from Rome.
Livy (59 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>–17 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>) was the one prose writer of note in the
Augustan age. His history of Rome is a great work of art, an
<hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> in prose, which celebrated the past greatness of Rome and the
virtues whereby this had been attained—those virtues which Augustus
aimed to revive.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The age of Nero.</hi> From Augustus to Nero there are no names of
note in Roman literature, but under the latter came a slight reawakening
of literary productivity. Seneca (4 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>–65 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), a Spaniard
from Corduba, Nero’s tutor, minister and victim, is best known as the
exponent of the practical Stoic religion and the only Roman tragedian
whose works have survived. His nephew Lucan (39–65 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>) portrayed
in his epic, the <hi rend="italic">Pharsalia</hi>, the struggle of the republicans
against Julius Caesar. His work shows a reawakening of a vain republican
idealism and is the counterpart to the Stoic opposition in
the senate. Petronius (d. 66 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), the arbiter of the refinements
of luxury at Nero’s court, displayed his originality by giving, in the
form of a novel, a skilful and lively picture of the society of the
freedmen in the Greek municipalities of South Italy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Flavian era.</hi> Under the Flavians, Pliny the Elder (23–79
<hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), a native of Cisalpine Gaul, compiled his <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi>,
which he aimed to make an encyclopaedia of information on the whole
world of nature. It is a work of monumental industry but displays a
lack of critical acumen and scientific training. At about the same
time there taught in Rome the Spaniard Quintilian (d. 95 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), who
wrote on the theory and practice of rhetoric, expressing in charming
<pb n="300"/><anchor id="Pg300"/>prose the Ciceronian ideal of life and education. His countryman
Martial (d. 102 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>) gave in satiric epigrams glimpses of the meaner
aspects of contemporary life.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Tacitus and his contemporaries.</hi> The freer atmosphere of the
government of Nerva and Trajan allowed the senatorial aristocracy
to voice feelings carefully suppressed under the terror of Domitian.
Their spokesman was Tacitus (55–116 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), a man of true genius,
who ranks next to Thucydides as the representative of artistic historical
writing in ancient times. His <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Orators</hi>, his
<hi rend="italic">Life of Agricola</hi>, and his descriptive account of the German peoples
(<hi rend="italic">Germania</hi>) were preludes to two great historical works, the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi>
and the <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi>, which together covered the period from 14–96 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
His attitude is strongly influenced by the persecutions of senators
under Domitian, and is the expression of his personal animosity and
that of the descendants of the older republican nobility towards the
principate in general. A friend of Tacitus, the younger Pliny
(62–113 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), imitated Cicero in collecting and publishing his letters.
This correspondence is valuable as an illustration of the life
and literary diletantism of educated circles of the day, as also for
the light it throws upon the administrative policies of Trajan. An
embittered critic of the age was the satirist Juvenal (d. about 130
<hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), from Aquinum in Italy, who wrote from a stoical standpoint
but with little learning and narrow vision. Somewhat later the first
literary history of Rome was written by Suetonius (75–150 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>),
who is better known as the author of the <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Caesars</hi> (from
Julius to Domitian), a series of gossipy narratives which set the style
for future historical writing in Rome.
</p>

<p>
With Hadrian begins the period of archaism in Roman literature,
that is, an artificial return to the Latin of Cato, Ennius and Plautus,
an unmistakable symptom of intellectual sterility.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Provincial literature.</hi> The progress of Romanization in the
provinces is clearly marked by the participation of provincials in the
literary life of Rome. From the Cisalpine, from Narbonese Gaul,
and from Spain, men with literary instincts and ability had been
drawn to the capital as the sole place where their talents would find
recognition. But gradually some of the provinces developed a Latin
culture of their own. The first evidences of this change came from
the age of the Antonines, when a Latin literature made its appearance
in the province of Africa. Its earliest representative was the
sophist Apuleius, the author of the romance entitled <hi rend="italic">The Golden Ass</hi>.
</p>

<pb n="301"/><anchor id="Pg301"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Christian literature.</hi> It was in Africa also that a Latin Christian
literature first arose, and it was the African Christian writers
who made Latin the language of the church in Italy and the West.
Of these Christian apologists the earliest and most influential was
Tertullian of Carthage, whose literary activity falls in the time of
the Severi. Cyprian and Arnobius continued his task in the third
century. In Minucius Felix, a contemporary of Tertullian, the
Christian community at Rome found an able defender of the faith.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Jurisprudence.</hi> In all other sciences the Romans sat at the feet
of the Greeks, but in that of jurisprudence they displayed both independence
and originality. The growth of Roman jurisprudence was
not hampered but furthered by the establishment of the principate,
for the development of a uniform administrative system for the whole
empire called for the corresponding development of a uniform system
of law. The study of law was stimulated by the practice of Augustus
and his successors who gave to prominent jurists the right of publicly
giving opinions (<hi rend="italic">jus publice respondendi</hi>) by his authority on the
legal merits of cases under trial. A further encouragement was given
by Hadrian’s organization of his judicial council. The great service
of the jurists of the principate was the introduction into Roman law
of the principles of equity founded on a philosophic conception of
natural law and the systematic organization and interpretation of the
body of the civil law. Roman jurisprudence reached its height between
the accession of Hadrian and the death of Severus Alexander.
The chief legal writers of this period were Julian in the time of
Hadrian, Gaius in the age of the Antonines, his contemporary Scaevola,
the three celebrated jurists of the time of the Severi—Papinian,
Paul and Ulpian, all pretorian prefects,—and lastly Modestine,
who closes the long line of classic juris-consults.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Greek literature.</hi> If we except the brief period of the Augustan
age, the Greek literature of the principate stands both in quantity
and quality above the Latin. Even Augustus had recognized Greek
as the language of government in the eastern half of the empire, and
with the gradual abandonment of his policy of preserving the domination
of the Italians over the provincials Greeks stood upon the same
footing as the Latin speaking provincials in the eyes of the imperial
government. In Rome the Greek author received the same recognition
as his Roman <hi rend="italic">confrère</hi>. Greek historians, geographers, scientists,
rhetoricians and philosophers wrote not only for Greeks, but
for the educated circles of the whole empire. And it was in Greek
<pb n="302"/><anchor id="Pg302"/>that the princeps Marcus Aurelius chose to write his Meditations.
Nor should it be forgotten that Greek was the language of the early
Christian writers, beginning with the Apostle Paul. By the opening
of the third century the champions of the new faith had begun to
rank among the leading authors of the day in the East as well as in
the West.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Plutarch (c. 50–120 A. D.) and Lucian (c. 125–200 A. D.)<anchor id="corr302"/><corr sic="(added)">.</corr></hi>
The best known names in the Greek literature of the principate are
Plutarch and Lucian. Plutarch’s <hi rend="italic">Parallel Lives</hi> of famous Greeks
and Romans possess a perpetual freshness and charm. Lucian was
essentially a writer of prose satires, a journalist who was <q>the last
great master of Attic eloquence and Attic wit.</q> In the realm of
science, Ptolemy the astronomer, and Galen the student of medicine,
both active in the second century, profoundly influenced their own
and subsequent times.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Philosophy.</hi> As we have seen, the doctrines of Stoicism continued
to appeal to the highest instincts of Roman character. Besides
Seneca and Marcus Aurelius this creed found a worthy exponent in
the ex-slave Epictetus, who taught between 90 and 120 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> at Nicopolis
in Epirus. With Plotinus (204–270 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), Greek philosophy
became definitely religious in character, resting upon the basis of
revelation and belief, not upon that of reason.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Art.</hi> Roman art found its chief inspiration in, and remained in
close contact with, Roman public life. The artists of the principate
may well have been Greeks, but they wrought for Romans and had
to satisfy Roman standards of taste. Realism and careful attention
to details may be said to be the two great characteristics of Roman
art. This is true both of Roman sculpture, which excelled in statues,
portrait busts, and the bas-reliefs depicting historical events with
which public monuments were richly decorated, and of the repoussé
and relief work which adorned table ware and other articles of silver,
bronze and pottery. The Roman fondness for costly decorations is
well illustrated by the elaborateness of the frescoes and the mosaics
of the villas of Pompeii, and other sites where excavations have revealed
the interiors of Roman public and private buildings. The
erection of the many temples, basilicas, baths, aqueducts, bridges,
amphitheatres and other structures in Rome, Italy and other provinces
supplied a great stimulus to Roman architecture and engineering. It
was in the use of the arch and the vault, particularly the vault of
<pb n="303"/><anchor id="Pg303"/>concrete, that the Roman architects excelled, and their highest
achievements were great vaulted structures like the Pantheon and the
Baths of Caracalla. The most striking testimony to the grandeur of
Rome comes from the remains of Roman architecture in the provinces—from
such imposing ruins as the Porta Nigra of Trèves, the
theatre at Orange, the Pont du Gard near Nîmes, the bridge over the
Tagus at Alcantara and the amphitheatres of Nîmes in France and
El-Djemm in Tunisia. But, like the literature, the Roman art of the
principate in time experienced a loss of creative power. It reached
its height under the Flavians and Trajan and then a steady deterioration
set in.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Causes of intellectual decline.</hi> The third century <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> witnessed
a general collapse of ancient civilization, no less striking in its cultural
than in its political and economic aspects. This cultural decline
was the result of political causes which had been gradually undermining
the foundations of a vigorous intellectual life. The culture
of Greece culminated in its scientific achievements of the third
century <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> At that time in comparison with the Greeks the neighboring,
peoples were at best semi-barbarians; in the eastern Mediterranean
the Greeks were the dominant race, still animated by a strong
love of political freedom. But the Roman conquest with its ruthless
exploitation of the provinces ruined the Greek world economically
and broke the morale of the Greek peoples, forcing them to seek their
salvation in fawning servility to Rome. The consequence was that
as the Greeks came under the dominion of Rome their creative impulses
withered, their intellectual progress ceased and their eyes were
turned backward upon their past achievements. And the Italians
themselves were on too low an intellectual level to develop a culture
of their own. They had not progressed beyond the adoption of certain
aspects of Greek culture before the century of civil wars between
133 and 30 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> resulted in the establishment of a type of government
which gradually crushed out the spirit of initiative in the
Latin speaking world. The material prosperity and peace during the
first two centuries of the principate made possible the diffusion of a
uniform type of culture throughout the empire as a whole, but after
the age of Augustus this is characterized both in the East and in the
West by its imitation of the past and its lack of creative power.
The third century <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> with its long period of civil war, foreign invasions,
and economic chaos, dealt a fatal blow to the material basis of
<pb n="304"/><anchor id="Pg304"/>ancient civilization. The collapse of Graeco-Roman culture was
rapid and complete, resembling the breakdown of the civilization of
the Aegean Bronze age toward the close of the second millennium before
the Christian era. Culturally, the fourth century <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> belongs
to the Middle Ages.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. The Imperial Cult and the Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The religious transformation of the Roman world.</hi> The religious
transformation of the Roman world during the principate was
fully as important for future ages as its political transformation.
This religious development consisted in the diffusion throughout the
empire of a group of religions which originated in the countries bordering
the eastern shores of the Mediterranean and hence are generally
known as Oriental cults. And among these oriental religions
are included both Judaism and Christianity.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The state cults.</hi> However, the worship of the divinities of
Graeco-Roman theology by no means died out during the first three
centuries of the Christian era. It continued to flourish in the state
cult of Rome, and the municipal cults of the Italian and provincial
towns. With the romanization of the semi-barbarous provinces
Graeco-Roman deities displaced or assimilated to themselves the gods
of the native populations. Druidism, the national religion of Gaul
and Britain, was suppressed chiefly because it fostered a spirit of
resistance to Roman rule. But the most widespread and vigorous of
the state cults was the worship of the princeps.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The imperial cult.</hi> We have already discussed the establishment
of the imperial cult by Augustus, as a visible expression of the
loyalty of the provincials and their acknowledgment of the authority
of Rome and the princeps. We have also seen how this cult was
perpetuated by the provincial councils organized for that purpose.
After the death of Augustus the imperial cult in the provinces gradually
came to include the worship of both the ruling Augustus and
the <hi rend="italic">Divi</hi>, or deceased emperors, who had received deification at the
hands of the Senate. This practise was established in all the eastern
provinces after the time of Claudius, and in the West under the
Flavians. In Rome where the cult of the ruling princeps was not
<pb n="305"/><anchor id="Pg305"/>practised, Domitian converted the temple of Augustus into a temple of
the <hi rend="italic">Divi</hi> or the Caesars.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The pagan Oriental cults.</hi> The pagan Oriental cults whose
penetration of the European provinces is so marked a feature in the
religious life of the principate were the cults of the peoples of western
Asia and Egypt which had become Hellenized and adapted for
world expansion after Alexander’s conquest of the Persian empire.
From this time onward they spread throughout the Greek culture
world but it was not until the establishment of the world empire of
Rome with its facilities for, and stimulus to, intercourse between
all peoples within the Roman frontiers that they were able to obtain
a foothold in western Europe. Their penetration of Italy began with
the official reception of the cult of the Great Mother of Pessinus at
Rome in 205 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, but the Roman world as a whole held aloof from
them until the close of the republic. However, during the first two
centuries of the principate they gradually made their way over the
western parts of the empire.
</p>

<p>
The expansion of the Oriental cults followed the lines of the much
frequented trade routes along which they were carried by travelers,
merchants and colonies of oriental traders. The army cantonments
were also centers for their diffusion, not only through the agency of
troops recruited in the East but also through detachments which had
seen service there in the course of the numerous wars on the eastern
frontiers. Likewise the oriental slaves were active propagandists of
their native faiths.
</p>

<p>
The explanation of the ready reception of these cults among all
classes of society is that they guaranteed their adherents a satisfaction
which the official religions were unable to offer. The state
and municipal cults were mainly political in character, and with the
disappearance of independent political life they lost their hold upon
men who began to seek a refuge from the miseries of the present
world in the world of the spirit and the promise of a future life.
This want the Oriental cults were able to meet with the doctrines of a
personal religion far different from the formal worship of the Graeco-Roman
deities.
</p>

<p>
Certain characteristics of doctrine and ritual were common to the
majority of the Oriental cults. They had an elaborate ritual which
appealed both to the senses and to the emotions of the worshippers.
By witnessing certain symbolic ceremonies the believer was roused
<pb n="306"/><anchor id="Pg306"/>to a state of spiritual ecstasy in which he felt himself in communion
with the deity, while by the performance of sacramental rites he felt
himself cleansed from the defilements of his earthly life and fitted for
a purer spiritual existence. A professional priesthood had charge of
the worship, ministered to the needs of individuals, and conducted
missionary work. To an age of declining intellectual vigor, when
men gave over the attempt to solve by scientific methods the riddle of
the universe, they spoke with the authority of revelation, giving a
comforting theological interpretation of life. And they appealed to
the conscience by imposing a rigid rule of conduct, the observance of
which would fit the believer for a happier existence in a future life.
</p>

<p>
The most important of these oriental divinities were the Great
Mother of Pessinus, otherwise known as Cybele, worshipped in company
with the male deity Attis; the Egyptian pair Isis and Serapis;
Atayatis or the Syrian goddess, the chief female divinity of North
Syria; a number of Syrian gods (Ba’als) named from the site of their
Syrian shrines; and finally Mithra, a deity whose cult had long
formed a part of the national Iranian religion. Towards all these
cults the Roman state displayed wide toleration, only interfering with
them when their orgiastic rites came into conflict with Roman conceptions
of morality. But in spite of this toleration it required a long
time before the conservative prejudices of the upper classes of Roman
society were sufficiently undermined to permit of their participation
in these foreign rites. For one hundred years after the introduction
of the worship of the Magna Mater Romans were prohibited from
enrolling themselves in the ranks of her priesthood. A determined
but unsuccessful attempt was made by the Senate during the last century
of the republic to drive from Rome the cult of Isis, the second
of these religions to find a home in Italy, and in 42 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi> the triumvirs
erected a temple to this goddess. Augustus, however, banished
her worship beyond the <hi rend="italic">pomerium</hi>. But this restriction was not enforced
by his successors, and by 69 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> the cult of the Egyptian
goddess was firmly established in the capital. The various Syrian
deities were of less significance in the religious life of the West, although
as we have seen Elagabalus set up the worship of one of them,
the Sun god of Emesa, as an official cult at Rome.
</p>

<p>
The Oriental cult which in importance overshadowed all the rest
was Mithraism, one of the latest to cross from Asia into Europe.
In Zoroastrian theology Mithra appears as the spirit who is the chief
<pb n="307"/><anchor id="Pg307"/>agent of the supreme god of light Ormuzd in his struggle against
Ahriman, the god of darkness. He is at the same time a beneficent
force in the natural world and in the moral world the champion of
righteousness against the powers of evil. Under Babylonian and
Greek influences Mithra was identified with the Sun-god, and appears
in Rome with the title the Unconquered Sun-god Mithra (<hi rend="italic">deus
invictus sol Mithra</hi>). Towards the close of the first century <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
Mithraism began to make its influence felt in Rome and the western
provinces, and from that time it spread with great rapidity. Mithra,
as the god of battles, was a patron deity of the soldiers, who became
his zealous missionaries in the frontier camps. His cult was also
regarded with particular favor by the emperors, whose authority it
supported by the doctrine that the ruler is the chosen of Ormuzd and
an embodiment of the divine spirit. It is not surprising then that
Aurelian, whose coins bore the legend <hi rend="italic">dominus et deus natus</hi> (born
god and lord), made the worship of the Unconquered Sun-god the
chief cult of the state.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Philosophy.</hi> Attention has already been called to the value of
Stoicism in supplying its adherents with a highly moral code of conduct.
Other philosophical systems, notably Epicureanism, likewise
inculcated particular rules of life. But the philosophical doctrines
which were best able to hold their own with the new religions were
those of Neoplatonism and Neopythagoreanism, which came into
vogue in the course of the second century, and exhibited a combination
of mysticism and idealism well suited to the spirit of the age.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Astrology and magic.</hi> Throughout the principate all classes of
society were deeply imbued with a superstitious fatalism which caused
them to place implicit belief in the efficacy of astrology and magic.
Chaldean and Egyptian astrologers enjoyed a great reputation, and
were consulted on all important questions. They were frequently
banished from Rome by the emperors who feared that their predictions
might give encouragement to their enemies. However, these
very emperors kept astrologers in their own service, and the decrees
of banishment never remained long in force. The almost universal
belief in miracles and oracles caused the appearance of a large number
of imposters who throve on the credulity of their clients. One
of the most celebrated of these was the Alexander who founded a new
oracle of Aesculapius at Abonoteichus in Paphlagonia, the fame of
which spread throughout the whole empire and even beyond its
bor<pb n="308"/><anchor id="Pg308"/>ders. In his exposé of the methods employed by this false prophet,
the satirist Lucian gives a vivid picture of the depraved superstition
of his time.
</p>

<p>
At the close of the principate the pagan world presented a great
confusion of religious beliefs and doctrines. However, the various
pagan cults were tolerant one of another, for the followers of one
god were ready to acknowledge the divinity of the gods worshipped
by their neighbors. On the contrary, the adherents of Judaism and
Christianity refused to recognize the pagan gods, and hence stood in
irreconcilable opposition to the whole pagan world.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">IV. Christianity and Its Relation to the Roman State</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Jews of the Roman empire.</hi> Alexander the Great’s conquest
of the Near East had thrown open to the Jews the whole Graeco-Macedonian
world, and Jewish settlements rapidly appeared in all its
important commercial centers. The Jewish colonies were encouraged
by the Hellenistic monarchs who granted them immunity from military
service, protection in the exercise of their religion, and a privileged
judicial status in the cities where they were established. In course
of time the number of Jews in these <hi rend="italic">diaspora</hi> became much greater
than in Judaea itself. Although the Jews resident outside of Syria
had adopted the Greek language, and were influenced in many ways
by their contact with Hellenistic culture, they still formed part of the
religious community presided over by the High Priest at Jerusalem,
and in addition to the annual contribution of two drachmas to the
temple of Jehovah, every Jew was expected to visit Jerusalem and
offer up sacrifice in the temple at least once in the course of his life.
Moreover, they were active in proselytizing and made many converts
among the Greeks and other peoples with whom they came into contact.
However, their connection with Judaea was purely religious
and not political in character.
</p>

<p>
The privileged status which the Jews had enjoyed in the Hellenistic
states was recognized by the Romans and was specifically confirmed
by Augustus, although this policy caused considerable dissatisfaction
among their Greek fellow townsmen. Furthermore, in deference to
the peculiarity of their religion, the Jews were not required to participate
in the imperial cult. However, the imperial government
made no attempt to foster settlements of the Jews in the western
<pb n="309"/><anchor id="Pg309"/>provinces, and during the early principate the only considerable Jewish
colony west of the Adriatic was that in Rome. With the exception
of Caligula, who tried to force the imperial cult upon the Jews,
the successors of Augustus did not interfere with the Jewish religion,
except to forbid its propaganda. The expulsions of the Jews from
Rome under Tiberius and Claudius were not religious persecutions
but police measures taken for the maintenance of good order within
the city.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Christianity and Judaism.</hi> The Christian religion had its origin
in Judaea as a result of the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, who was
crucified by the Roman authorities in the principate of Tiberius,
after having been condemned for blasphemy by the Sanhedrin, the
Jewish high court for the enforcement of the law of Moses. From
Judaea Christianity spread to the Jewish <hi rend="italic">diaspora</hi> through the missionary
activity of the disciples and other followers of Jesus, particularly
the Apostle Paul. Although the Christian propaganda was
not confined to these Jewish communities, it was among them that
the first Christian congregations arose, and this, with the Jewish
origin of the new faith, caused the Christians to be regarded by the
Roman government as a sect of the Jews. In 49 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Claudius banished
the Jews from Rome because of disorders among them between
the Christians and the adherents of the older faith. Nero’s persecution
of the Christians in 64 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> was, as we have seen, not undertaken
on religious grounds, and was perhaps due to Jewish instigation.
On the whole, the Christians benefited by the attitude of Rome
towards their sect, for it gave them the benefit of the immunities which
the adherents of Judaism enjoyed.
</p>

<p>
Although the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> brought about
the predominance of the non-Jewish element in the Christian ranks,
until the end of the rule of the Flavians the Roman official world
made no distinction between Jew and Christian. Domitian apparently
exacted the <hi rend="italic">didrachma</hi> from both alike. Towards the close
of his reign, in 95 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, this princeps executed or banished a number
of Romans of senatorial rank on charges of atheism or conversion to
Judaism. Among the victims were some who professed Christianity.
At the same time the Christian communities of Asia Minor seem to
have suffered a rather serious persecution on the part of the state.
However, this may have been due to disturbances between the Christian
and the non-Christian elements in the Greek cities, and there
<pb n="310"/><anchor id="Pg310"/>is no definite proof that Domitian made the suppression of Christianity
part of the public policy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Christianity and the Roman state.</hi> After Domitian, Christians
were no longer liable to the <hi rend="italic">didrachma</hi>, and therefore lost their claim
to the privileges and exemptions of the Jews. A conflict with the
secular power was rendered inevitable by the very nature of Christianity,
which was non-Roman, non-national, and monotheistic, refusing
recognition to the cults of the state, and denying the divinity of
the ruler. The Romans regarded the imperial cult from the political
standpoint and considered the refusal to recognize the divinity of the
princeps as an act of treason. On the other hand, Christians looked
upon the question as a matter of conscience and morality and regarded
the worship of the princeps as an act of idolatry. They could pray
for him, but not to him. These two points of view were impossible
of reconciliation. Furthermore, since the worship of the state gods
formed such an integral part of the public life of each community,
it was inevitable that those who refused to participate in this worship
should be looked upon as atheists and public enemies. On another
ground also the Christians were liable to punishment under the <hi rend="italic">lex
maiestatis</hi>, namely, as forming unauthorized religious associations.
These constituted the crimes for which the Christians were actually
punished from the close of the first to the middle of the third century
of our era.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Popular accusations against the Christians.</hi> However, throughout
this period the state did not take the initiative against
Christians as such, but only dealt with those individuals against whom
specific charges were laid by private initiative or the action of local
magistrates. These popular accusations charged the Christians with
forming illegal associations, with seeking the destruction of mankind
(as <hi rend="italic">odiatores humani generis</hi>), and with perpetrating all sorts of
monstrous crimes in their religious rites. Such accusations were
partly due to the belief of the early Christian church in the immediate
coming of the kingdom of Christ, to their consequent scorn of wealth
and public honors, and to the secrecy which surrounded the exercise
of their religion.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The imperial policy from Trajan to Maximus.</hi> The attitude
of the Roman government towards the Christians in the early second
century is clearly seen from the correspondence between Trajan and
Pliny the younger, the governor of Bithynia in 112 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> This
    cor<pb n="311"/><anchor id="Pg311"/>respondence fails to reveal any specific law prohibiting Christianity,
but shows that the admission of the name of Christian, accompanied
by the refusal to worship the gods of the state and the princeps,
constituted sufficient grounds for punishment. Thus a great deal of
discretion was left to the provincial governor, who was directed to
pay no attention to anonymous accusations but who was expected to
repress Christianity whenever its spread caused conflicts with the
non-Christian element under his authority. A rescript of Hadrian
to Minucius Fundanus, proconsul of Asia, ordained that Christians
should receive the benefit of a regular trial, and that they should not
be condemned for the name, but for some definite crime, <hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi>, for
treason. An exception to the general policy of the emperors in the
second century was the persecution of the Christian community at
Lyons authorized by Marcus Aurelius. With the state straining every
nerve in its struggle with the barbarians, he regarded the Christians
as defaulters to the cause of the empire, and as unreasonable, ecstatic
transgressors of the law. The attitude of Septimius Severus towards
the Christians was in harmony with the procedure of Trajan and
Hadrian. In 202 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> he ordered the governor of Syria to forbid
Jewish proselytizing and Christian propaganda, but forbade that
Christians should be sought out with the object of persecution. Severus
Alexander showed himself well-disposed towards Christianity
and the brief persecution of Maximinus the Thracian was merely a
spasmodic expression of hatred against those protected by his predecessor.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The persecutions of the third century.</hi> By the middle of the
third century the Christian church was in a flourishing condition. It
numbered among its adherents men in all walks of life, its leaders
were men of culture and ability, and abandoning the attitude of the
early church towards the Kingdom of Heaven, the Christians were
taking an active part in the society in which they lived. The number
of the Christians was so great as to disquiet the government, since
in view of their attitude towards the cults of the state they were
still traitors in the eyes of the law. And so in their struggle against
the forces which threatened the dissolution of the empire, certain of
its rulers sought to stamp out Christianity as a means of restoring
religious and political harmony and loyalty among their subjects.
The Christians were regarded as enemies within the gates and the
calamities of the time were attributed to the anger of the gods towards
<pb n="312"/><anchor id="Pg312"/>these unbelievers. In 250 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Decius reversed the principle enunciated
by Septimius Severus and ordained that Christians were to
be sought out and brought to trial. This was accomplished by ordering
all the citizens of the empire by municipalities to perform public
acts of worship to the gods of the state. Those who refused were
punished. The persecution of Decius was terminated by his death
in 251, but his policy was renewed by Valerian in 257 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> In that
year Valerian required the Christians to offer sacrifice publicly, forbade
their reunions and closed their cemeteries. In 258 he ordered
the immediate trial of bishops, priests and other officers of the
churches, and set penalties for the various grades of the clergy who
persisted in their beliefs. But Valerian’s persecution also was brief
and ended with his defeat and capture by the Persians in 258 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
Naturally, in so large a body as the Christians now were not all
were animated by the zeal and sincerity of the early brethren, and
under threat of punishment many, at least openly, abjured their faith.
However, many others cheerfully suffered martyrdom and by their
example furthered the Christian cause. Truly, <q>the blood of the
martyrs was the seed of the church.</q> The persecutions tried the
church sorely, but it emerged triumphant from the ordeal.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Organization of the Christian church.</hi> The early Christians
formed a number of small, independent communities, united by ties
of common interest, of belief, and of continual intercourse. Although
the majority of their members were drawn, from the humbler walks
of life, they were by no means confined to the proletariat. In their
organization these communities were all of the same general type,
resembling the Roman religious <hi rend="italic">collegia</hi>, but local variations were
common. Each church community was directed by a committee,
whose members were called at times elders (presbyters), at times
overseers (bishops). These were assisted by deacons, who, like themselves,
were elected by the congregation to which they belonged.
Among the presbyters or bishops one may have acted as president.
The functions of the bishops were primarily administrative, including
the care of the funds of the association, the care of the poor, the
friendless, and traveling brethren, and of discipline among the members
of the community. The deacons were the subordinates of the
bishops, and assisted in the religious services and the general administration
of the community.
</p>

<p>
But before the close of the principate this loose organization had
<pb n="313"/><anchor id="Pg313"/>been completely changed as a result of separatist tendencies among
the Christians themselves and the increasing official oppression to
which they were exposed. The opposition to these forces resulted
in a strict formulation of evangelic doctrine and a firmer organization
of the church communities. This organization came to be centralized
in the hands of the bishops, now the representatives of the communities.
The episcopate was no longer collegiate, but monarchical, and
claimed authority by virtue of apostolic succession. Apparently the
president of the committee of bishops or presbyters had become the
sole bishop, and the presbyters had become priests subject to his
authority, although at times presiding over separate congregations.
The bishops were now regularly nominated by the clergy, approved
by the congregation, and finally inducted into office by the ceremony
of ordination. Besides their administrative powers, the bishops had
the guardianship of the traditions and doctrines of the church. The
clergy were now salaried officers, sharply distinguished from the
laity, who gradually ceased to participate actively in the government
and regulation of worship of their respective communities, and these
communities had developed into corporations organized on a juristic
basis, promising redemption to their members and withholding it from
deserters.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The primacy of Rome.</hi> In the third century, a movement took
place for the organization of the separate churches in larger unions,
and in this way the provincial synods arose. In these the metropolitan
bishops, that is, those from the provincial administrative centers,
assumed the leadership. Among the churches of the empire as a
whole two rival tendencies made themselves manifest. The one was
to accord equal authority to all the bishops, the other to recognize
the supremacy of the bishop of Rome. The claim for the primacy
of the Roman see was based upon the imperial political status of
Rome, and the special history of the Roman church. It was strongly
pressed by certain bishops of the second century who laid emphasis
upon the claim of the Roman bishopric to have been established by
the Apostle Peter.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The epoch-making character of Diocletian’s reign.</hi> Upon
Diocletian devolved the task of bringing order out of chaos, of rebuilding
the shattered fabric of the Roman empire, of reëstablishing
the civil administration and taking effective measures to secure an
enduring peace. Like many of the emperors of the third century,
Diocletian was an Illyrian of humble origin who by sheer ability
and force of character had won his way up from the ranks to the
imperial throne. In attacking the problem of imperial restoration
he displayed restless energy and versatility, a thorough-going radicalism
which knew little respect for traditions, and a supreme confidence
in his ability to restore the economic welfare of the empire by legislative
means. In his administrative reforms he gave expression to the
tendencies which had been at work in the later principate and with
him begins the period of undisguised autocracy, in which the emperor,
supported by the army and the bureaucracy, is the sole source
of authority in the state. Like Augustus, Diocletian was the founder
of a new régime; one in which the absolutist ideal of Julius Caesar
finally attained realization.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Maximian co-emperor, 286 A. D.</hi> One of the first acts of Diocletian
was to coöpt as his associate in the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>, with the rank of
Caesar, a Pannonian officer named Valerius Maximianus. In 286
Maximian received the title of Augustus and equal authority with
Diocletian. However, the latter always dominated his younger colleague,
and really determined the imperial policy. In conformity
with the undisguised absolutism of his rule, Diocletian assumed the
divine title of Jovius, and that of Herculius was bestowed upon
Maximian. Diocletian’s choice of a co-emperor was determined
<pb n="318"/><anchor id="Pg318"/>largely by the conviction that the burden of empire was too heavy
to be borne by one man. He therefore entrusted the defense of the
western provinces to Maximian, while he devoted his attention to
the Danubian and eastern frontiers. Maximian’s first task was to
quell a serious revolt of the Gallic peasants, called Bagaudae, occasioned
by the exactions of the state and the landholders. After crushing
this outbreak (285 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), he successfully defended the Rhine
frontier against the attacks of Franks, Alamanni and Burgundians
(286–88 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). However, in the meantime a usurper had arisen in
Carausius, an officer entrusted with the defense of the Gallic coast
against the North Sea pirates, who made himself master of Britain
and proclaimed himself Augustus (286 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Maximian was unable
to subdue him, and the two emperors were forced against their will
to acknowledge him as their colleague.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Regulation of the succession.</hi> Diocletian saw in the absence of
a strict regulation of the succession a fertile cause of civil strife. To
do away with this, and to discourage the rise of usurpers, as well as
to relieve the Augusti of a part of their military and administrative
burdens, he determined to appoint two Caesars as the assistants and
destined successors of Maximian and himself. His choice fell upon
Gaius Galerius and Flavius Valerius Constantius, both Illyrian officers
of tried military capacity. They received the title of Caesar on
1 March, 293 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> To cement the tie between the Caesars and the
Augusti, Diocletian adopted Galerius and gave him his daughter in
marriage, while Maximian bound Constantius to himself in the same
way. It was the plan of Diocletian that the Augusti should voluntarily
abdicate after a definite period, and be succeeded by the
Caesars, who in turn should then nominate and adopt their successors.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The division of the empire.</hi> To each of the four rulers there
was assigned a part of the empire as his particular administrative
sphere. Diocletian took Thrace, Egypt and the Asiatic provinces,
fixing his headquarters at Nicomedia. Maximian received Italy,
Raetia, Spain and Africa, and took up his residence at Milan. To
Galerius were allotted the Danubian provinces and the remainder
of the Balkan peninsula, with Sirmium as his residence; while
Constantius, to whose lot fell the provinces of Gaul, established himself
at Trèves. However, this arrangement was not a fourfold division
of the empire, for the Caesars were subject to the authority of
<pb n="319"/><anchor id="Pg319"/>the Augusti, and imperial edicts were issued in the name of all four
rulers. Additional unity was given to the government by the personal
ascendancy which Diocletian continued to maintain over his associates.
One result of this arrangement was that Rome ceased to be the permanent
imperial residence and capital of the empire, Milan and later
Ravenna being preferred as the seat of government for the West.
This change was largely the result of the exclusion of the Senate
from all active participation in the government, and the fact that
Rome retained traditions of republican and senatorial rule incompatible
with the spirit of the new order. Yet, in spite of its loss of
prestige, the Eternal City continued to hold a privileged status, and
its citizens were fed and amused at the expense of the empire.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The restoration of the frontiers.</hi> The division of the military
authority among four able commanders enabled the government to
deal energetically with all frontier wars or internal revolts. In 296
Constantius recovered Britain from Allectus, who three years previously
had overthrown Carausius and proclaimed himself Augustus.
In 297 Maximian was forced to appear in person in Africa to suppress
a revolt of the Quinquegentiani. Meanwhile, Diocletian crushed a
usurper named Achilles in Egypt and repulsed the invading Blemyes.
Galerius, under the orders of Diocletian, after repelling attacks of the
Iazyges (294 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>) and Carpi (296 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), was called upon to meet
a Persian invasion of Armenia and Mesopotamia. He was at first
severely defeated, but, after being reinforced, won a decisive victory
over Narses, the Persian king, and recovered Armenia. Diocletian
himself won back Mesopotamia and the Persians were forced to
acknowledge the Roman suzerainty over Armenia, while the Roman
frontier in Mesopotamia was advanced to the upper Tigris. In all
parts of the empire the border defenses were repaired and strengthened.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Army reforms; provincial organization.</hi> The military reforms
of Diocletian aimed to correct the weakness revealed in the previous
system by the wars of the third century. He created a powerful
mobile force—the <hi rend="italic">comitatenses</hi>; while organizing the permanent garrison
along the frontier in the form of a border militia—the <hi rend="italic">limitanei</hi>.
At the same time, the military and civil authority in the
provinces was sharply divided to prevent a dangerous concentration
of power in the hands of any one official. And the same motive is
to be traced in the subdivision of the province, the number of which
<pb n="320"/><anchor id="Pg320"/>was raised to 101. These were grouped in thirteen dioceses, administered
by <hi rend="italic">vicarii</hi> (vicars), who were subordinate to the praetorian
prefects.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The edict of prices, 301 A. D.</hi> Diocletian also made a thorough
revision of the system of taxation, and tried, but without success, to
establish a satisfactory monetary standard. A more conspicuous failure,
however, was his attempt to stabilize economic conditions by government
regulation. By the Edict of Prices issued in 301, he fixed
a uniform price for each commodity and every form of labor or professional
service throughout the empire. The penalty of death was
provided for all who demanded or offered more than the legal price.
The law proved impossible to enforce. It took no account of the
variations of supply and demand in the various parts of the empire,
of the difference between wholesale and retail trade, or in the quality
of articles of the same kind. In spite of the severe penalty prescribed,
the provisions of the law were so generally disregarded that the government
abandoned the attempt to carry them into effect.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Persecution of the Christians, 302 A. D.</hi> Equally unsuccessful
were his measures for the suppression of Christianity. For nearly
half a century following Valerian’s persecution the Christians had
enjoyed immunity from repressive legislation. They had continued
to increase rapidly in numbers and it has been estimated that at this
time perhaps two-fifths of the population of the empire were adherents
of the Christian faith. The reason for the revival of persecution
by Diocletian is uncertain, although it may possibly have been
at the instigation of Galerius, who displayed the greatest zeal in
carrying it into effect. In 302 Diocletian issued three edicts, ordering
the confiscation of church property, the dismissal of Christians from
civil offices, the abrogation of their judicial rights, the enslavement
of Christians of plebeian status, the arrest and imprisonment of the
heads of the church, and heavy penalties for those who refused to
offer sacrifice to the state gods, while granting liberty to all who did
so. In 304, a fourth edict ordered all citizens without exception to
make public sacrifice and libation to the gods. The degree to which
these edicts were enforced varied in the different parts of the empire.
The most energetic persecutors were Maximian and Galerius, while
in Gaul Constantius made little or no effort to molest the Christians.
The persecution lasted with interruptions till 313 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Many leading
Christians met a martyr’s death, but the church emerged from the
<pb n="321"/><anchor id="Pg321"/>ordeal more strongly organized and aggressive than before. Its victory
made it a political force of supreme importance.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Abdication, 305 A. D.</hi> On 1 May, 305 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, Diocletian and
Maximian, after a joint rule of twenty years, formally abdicated their
authority and retired into private life. Diocletian withdrew to his
palace near Salona in Dalmatia, and Maximian, much against his
will, to an estate in Lucania. Galerius and Constantius succeeded
them as Augusti.
</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. Constantine I, the Great: 306–337 a. d.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Constantine Caesar, 306 A. D.</hi> Diocletian’s plan for securing
an orderly succession of rulers for the empire had neglected to take
into account individual ambitions and the strength of dynastic loyalty
among the soldiers. Its failure was forecast in the appointment of
the new Caesars. Galerius, who was the more influential of the
new Augusti, disregarded the claims of Constantine, the son of Constantius,
and nominated two of his own favorites, Severus and Maximinus
Daia. In this Constantius acquiesced but when he died in
Britain in 306 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, his army acclaimed Constantine as his successor.
Galerius was forced to acknowledge him as Caesar.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The revolt of Maxentius, 306 A. D.</hi> In the same year Maxentius,
the son of Maximian, took advantage of the opposition aroused
in Rome by the attempt of Galerius to make the city subject to taxation,
and caused himself to be proclaimed Caesar. He was supported
by his father, who emerged from his enforced retirement, and
defeated and brought about the death of Severus, whom Galerius
had made Augustus, and sent to subdue him. Maxentius then took
the title of Augustus for himself. The same rank was accorded
to Constantine by Maximian, who made an alliance with him and
gave him his daughter, Fausta, in marriage. Upon the failure of an
attempt by Galerius to overthrow Maxentius, an appeal was made to
Diocletian to return to power and put an end to the rivalries of his
successors (307 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). He refused to do so, but induced Maximian,
who had quarrelled with his son, to withdraw a second time from
public life. Licinius, who had been made Caesar by Galerius in
place of Severus, became an Augustus, while Daia and Constantine
each received the title of Son of Augustus (<hi rend="italic">filius Augusti</hi>), a distinction
which Constantine, from the beginning, and Daia, soon
after<pb n="322"/><anchor id="Pg322"/>wards, ignored. Thus, by 310 A. D., there were five Augusti (including
Maxentius), in the empire and no Caesars. It was not long
before the ambitions of the rival emperors led to a renewal of civil war.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The rival Augusti, 310–312 A. D.</hi> In 310 Maximian tried to
win over the army of Constantine, but his attempt failed and cost him
his life. The following year Galerius died, after having, in concert
with Constantine and Licinius, issued an edict which put an end to
the persecution of the Christians and granted them the right to practice
their religion; an admission that the state had failed in its plan to
stamp out the religion of Christ. The empire was then divided as
follows: Constantine held Britain, Gaul and Raetia, Maxentius
Spain, Italy and Africa, Licinius the Illyrian and Balkan provinces,
and Maximinus Daia the lands to the east of the Aegean, including
Egypt. The attempt of Maxentius to add Raetia to his dominions
brought him into conflict with Constantine. Constantine allied himself
with Licinius, and Maxentius found a supporter in Maximinus.
Without delay Constantine invaded Italy, and routed the troops of
Maxentius at Verona. He then pressed on to Rome and won a final
victory not far from the Milvian bridge (312 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Maxentius
perished in the rout. It was in this campaign, as a result of a vision,
that Constantine adopted as his standard the <hi rend="italic">labarum</hi>, a cross combined
with the Christian monogram formed of the first two letters
of the Greek word <hi rend="italic">Christos</hi> (Christ).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Constantine and Licinius, 313–324 A. D.</hi> In 313 Constantine
and Licinius met at Milan, where they issued a joint edict of toleration,
which placed Christianity upon an equal footing with the pagan
cults of the state. Although this edict enunciated the principle of
religious toleration for the empire, it was issued with a view to win
the political support of the Christians and pointed unmistakably to
Christianity as the future state religion. Shortly after the publication
of the Edict of Milan, Maximinus Daia crossed the Bosphorus
and invaded the territory of Licinius. He was defeated by the latter,
who followed up his advantage and occupied Asia Minor. Upon
the death of Maximinus, which followed within a short time, Licinius
fell heir to the remaining eastern provinces. These now received the
religious toleration previously extended to the rest of the empire.
</p>

<p>
However, the concord between the surviving Augusti was soon
broken by the ambitions of Constantine, who felt aggrieved since
Licinius controlled a larger share of the empire than himself. A
brief war ensued, which was terminated by an agreement whereby
<pb n="323"/><anchor id="Pg323"/>Licinius ceded to Constantine the dioceses of Moesia and Pannonia
(314 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). In 317 they jointly nominated as Caesars and their
successors, Crispus and Constantine, the younger sons of Constantine,
and Licinianus, the son of Licinius. However, although they continued
to act in harmony for some years longer, it was evident that
they still regarded one another with jealous suspicion. This came
clearly to light in the difference of their policies towards the Christians.
The more Constantine courted their support by granting them
special privileges, the more Licinius tended to regard them with disfavor
and restrict their religious liberty. Finally, in 322 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, when
repelling a Gothic inroad, Constantine led his forces into the territory
of Licinius, who treated the trespass as an act of war. Constantine
won a signal victory at Adrianople and his son Crispus
destroyed the fleet of Licinius at the Hellespont. These disasters
induced Licinius to withdraw to Asia Minor. There he was completely
defeated by Constantine near Chrysopolis (18 September, 324
<hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Licinius surrendered upon assurance of his life, but the following
year he was executed on a charge of treason. Constantine
was now sole emperor.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Constantine sole emperor, 324–337 A. D.</hi> Constantine’s administrative
policy followed in the steps of Diocletian, whose organization
he elaborated and perfected in many respects. The praetorian prefecture
was deprived of its military authority, which was conferred upon
the newly-created military offices of master of the horse and the foot
(<hi rend="italic">magister equitum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">peditum</hi>). This completed the separation
between the military and civil offices. Diocletian’s field force was
strengthened by the creation of new mobile units, and his efficient
army enabled Constantine to defend the empire against all barbarian
attacks. Upon waste lands within the frontiers he settled Sarmatians
and Vandals, while he greatly increased the barbarian element in the
army as a whole, but particularly among the officers of higher rank.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Constantinople, 330 A. D.</hi> Of special importance for the future
history of the empire was the founding of a new capital, called Constantinople,
on the site of ancient Byzantium. After four years’
preparation, the new city was formally dedicated on 11 May, 330 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
The choice of the site of the new capital of the empire was determined
by its strategic importance. It was conveniently situated with respect
to the eastern and Danubian frontiers, and well adapted as a link
between the European and Asiatic parts of the empire. The aim of
the emperor was to make Constantinople a new Rome, and he gave
<pb n="324"/><anchor id="Pg324"/>it the organization and the institutions of Rome on the Tiber. A
new Senate was established there; likewise the public festivals and
free bread for the populace. For the latter purpose the grain of
Egypt was diverted from Rome to Constantinople.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Constantine and the succession.</hi> Like Diocletian, Constantine
realized the necessity of having more than a single ruler for the
empire, but he determined to choose his associates from the members
of his own household. Accordingly, following Crispus and Constantine,
his younger sons, Constantius and Constans, were given the title
of Caesar, while Licinianus, the son of Licinius, was gotten rid of in
326. In the same year Crispus was also put to death. The cause
of his fall is uncertain. It involved the death of his stepmother,
Fausta, the mother of Constantine’s other sons. Ultimately, the three
surviving Caesars were set over approximately equal portions of the
empire. In 335 Constantine the younger governed Britain, Gaul
and Illyricum; Constans ruled Italy, Africa and Pannonia; and
Constantius was in control of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt. In
that year Constantine appointed as a fourth Caesar his nephew,
Delmatius, to whom he intended to entrust the government of Thrace,
Macedonia and Achaea. At the same time, Annabalianus, a brother
of Delmatius, was designated as the future ruler of Pontus and
Armenia, with the title of King of Kings.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Constantine’s Christianity.</hi> Constantine died in May, 337 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
shortly after having been baptized into the Christian church. Although
his mother, Helena, was a Christian, it seems improbable
that Constantine himself was from the first an adherent of that faith.
On the whole, one may say that his attitude towards Christianity
was determined largely by political rather than religious convictions.
However, his mother’s influence and his father’s toleration of Christianity
doubtless predisposed him to consider the Christians with
favor. He soon sought the support of the Christians on political
grounds, and his successes over his rivals seem to have confirmed him
in this policy. Finally, he appears to have seen in Christianity the
religion best suited to a universal faith for the empire. However,
Constantine himself did not raise Christianity to that position, although
he prepared the way to this end. Although he forbade the
performance of private sacrifices and magical rites, in other respects
he adhered faithfully to his policy of religious toleration. He took
the title of <hi rend="italic">pontifex maximus</hi>, maintained the imperial cult, and until
<pb n="325"/><anchor id="Pg325"/>330 issued coins with the image of the Sun-god, with whom the
emperor was often identified. His designation of Sunday as a general
holiday in 321 was in full accord with this policy of toleration,
for although this was the day celebrated by the Christians as <q>the
Lord’s day,</q> as the <q>day of the Sun</q> it could be celebrated by
pagans also. Nevertheless, he exhibited an ever-increasing personal
leaning towards Christianity, and granted special privileges to the
Christian clergy. He caused his sons to be brought up as Christians,
and really established a special relation between the emperor and the
church. For his services to the cause of Christianity he well merited
the title of <q>the Great,</q> bestowed upon him by Christian historians.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. The Dynasty of Constantine: 337–363 a. d.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Constantine II, Constans and Constantius, 337–340 A. D.</hi>
Constantine’s plans for the succession were thwarted by the troops
at Constantinople, who, instigated, as was said, by Constantius,
refused to acknowledge any other rulers than the sons of Constantine
and put to death the rest of his relatives, with the exception of his
two youthful nephews, Gallus and Julian. Constantius and his two
brothers then declared themselves Augusti and divided the empire.
Constantine II received Spain, Gaul and Britain, Constantius Thrace,
Egypt and the Orient, while the youngest, Constans, took the central
dioceses, Africa, Italy and Illyricum. However, this arrangement
endured only for a brief time. The peace was broken by Constantine,
who encroached upon the territory of Constans, and affected to play
the rôle of the senior Augustus. However, he was defeated and
killed at Aquileia by the troops of Constans, who annexed his
dominions.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Constantius and Constans, 340–350 A. D.</hi> The joint rule of
Constantius and Constans lasted for ten years. The latter showed
himself an energetic sovereign and maintained peace in the western
part of the empire. At length, however, his harshness and personal
vices cost him the loyalty of his own officers, who caused him to be deposed
in favor of Magnentius, an officer of Frankish origin (350 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>)<anchor id="corr325"/><corr sic="period missing">.</corr>
And while Magnentius secured recognition in Italy and the West, <anchor id="corr325a"/><corr sic="th">the</corr>
army in Illyricum raised its commander, Vetranio, to the purple.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Constantius sole emperor, 350–360 A. D.</hi> From 338 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Constantius
had been engaged in an almost perpetual but indecisive
<pb n="326"/><anchor id="Pg326"/>struggle with Sapor II, king of Persia, over the possession of
Mesopotamia and Armenia. It was not until late in 350 that he
was able to leave the eastern frontier to attempt to reëstablish the
authority of his house in the West. He soon came to an agreement
with Vetranio, who seems to have accepted the title of Augustus solely
to save Illyricum from Magnentius. Vetranio passed into honorable
retirement, but when Constantius refused to recognize Magnentius
as Augustus the latter marched eastwards to enforce his claims. He
was defeated in a desperate battle at Mursa in Pannonia (351 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>),
where the victory was won by the mailed horsemen of Constantius,
who from this time onwards formed the most effective arm in the
Roman service. In the next year Constantius recovered Italy, and in
353 invaded Gaul, whereupon Magnentius took his own life.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Gallus, Caesar, 351–4 A. D.</hi> Constantius had no son, and so to
strengthen his position, he made his cousin, Gallus, Caesar and
placed him in charge of the Orient when he set out to meet Magnentius
in 351 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> But Gallus soon showed himself unworthy of his office.
His mistreatment of the representatives of the emperor sent to investigate
his conduct caused him to be suspected of treasonable ambitions,
and he was recalled and put to death in 354 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Julian, Caesar, 335 A. D.</hi> However, Constantius still found himself
in need of an associate in the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>. In addition to the
danger of invasion on both northern and eastern frontiers, came the
revolt of Silvanus at Cologne in 355, which, although quickly suppressed,
was a reminder that every successful general was potentially
a candidate for the throne. Accordingly, at the advice of the empress
Eudoxia, he called from the enforced seclusion of a scholar’s life
Julian, the younger brother of Gallus, whom he made Caesar and
dispatched to Gaul (355 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Since the fall of Magnentius the
Gallic provinces had been exposed to the devastating incursions of
Franks and Alemanni, and the first task of the young Caesar was
to deal with these barbarians. In a battle near Strassburg in 357
he broke the power of the Alemanni, and drove them over the Rhine.
The Franks were forced to acknowledge Roman overlordship, but
the Salian branch of that people were allowed to settle to the south
of the Rhine (358 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). In addition to displaying unexpected
capacities as a general, Julian showed himself a forceful and upright
administrator, whose chief aim was to revive the prosperity of his
sorely-tried provincials.
</p>

<pb n="327"/><anchor id="Pg327"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Julian, Augustus, 360 A. D.</hi> In 359 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> a fresh invasion of
Mesopotamia by Sapor II called Constantius to the East. The
seriousness of the situation there caused him to demand considerable
reinforcements from the army in Gaul. This was resented both by
the soldiers themselves and by Julian, who saw in the order a prelude
to his own undoing, for he knew the suspicious nature of his cousin,
and was aware that his own successes and the restraint he imposed
upon the rapacity of his officials had aroused the enmity of those
who had the emperor’s confidence. However, after a vain protest,
he yielded; but the troops took matters into their own hands, mutinied
and hailed Julian as Augustus. His ambitions, which had been
awakened by the taste of power, and the precariousness of his present
situation led him to accept the title (360 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). He then sought to
obtain from Constantius recognition of his position and the cession
of the western provinces. The latter rejected his demand, although
he did not deem it advisable to leave the East unprotected at that
moment and attempt to reassert his authority. Julian then took the
offensive to enforce his claims, and, upon the retirement of the Persian
army, Constantius hastened to meet him. But on the march he
fell ill and died in Cilicia, having designated Julian as his successor.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The pagan reaction.</hi> The importance of Julian’s reign lies in
his attempt to make paganism once more the dominant religion of
the empire. His own early saturation with the fascinating literature
of Hellenism and the mystical strain in his character made Julian
an easy convert to Neo-platonism. He had become a pagan in
secret before he had been called to the Caesarship, and after the
death of Constantius openly proclaimed his apostacy. While he
adhered in general to the principle of religious toleration and did
not institute any systematic persecution of the Christians, he prohibited
them from interpreting classical literature in the schools,
forced them to surrender many pagan shrines which they had occupied,
deprived the clergy of their immunities, endeavored to sow
dissension in their ranks by supporting unorthodox bishops, and
stimulated a literary warfare against them in which he himself took
a prominent part. Following the example of Maximinus Daia, Julian
attempted to combat Christianity with its own weapons, and tried to
establish a universal pagan church with a clergy and liturgy on the
Christian model. He also sought to infuse paganism with the morality
and missionary zeal of Christianity. But his efforts were in
<pb n="328"/><anchor id="Pg328"/>
vain; the pagan cults had lost their appeal for the masses, and the
only converts were those who sought to win the imperial favor by
abandoning the Christian faith.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Persian war and death, 363 A. D.</hi> In his administration of the
empire Julian pursued the same policy as in Gaul. He checked
the greed of government officials, abolished oppressive offices, and
in every way tried to restrain extravagances and lighten the burdens
of his subjects. The war with Persia which had begun under Constantius
had not been concluded and Julian was fired by the ambition
to imitate the career of Alexander the Great and overthrow the Persian
kingdom. After long preparations he began his attack early
in 363 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> He succeeded in reaching Ctesiphon where he defeated
a Persian army. But his attempt to penetrate further into the enemy’s
country failed for want of supplies, and he was forced to begin a
retreat. On the march up the Tigris valley he was mortally wounded
in a skirmish (26 June, 363 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), and with his death ended the rule
of the dynasty of Constantine the Great.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Jovian, 363–4 A. D.</hi> The army chose as his successor Jovian,
the commander of the imperial guard. To rescue his forces, Jovian
made peace with Sapor, surrendering the Roman territory east of
the Tigris, with part of Mesopotamia, and abandoning the Roman
claim to suzerainty over Armenia. Julian’s enactments against the
Christians were abrogated and religious toleration proclaimed. After
a brief reign of eight months, Jovian died at Antioch in 364 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Valentinian I and Valens, Augusti, 364 A. D.</hi> At the death of
Jovian the choice of the military and civil officials fell upon Flavius
Valentinianus, an officer of Pannonian origin. He nominated as his
co-ruler his brother, Valens, whom he set over the East, reserving
the West for himself.
</p>

<p>
Valentinian’s reign was an unceasing struggle to protect the western
provinces against barbarian invaders. The emperor personally directed
the defense of the Rhine and Danubian frontiers against the
incursions of the Alemanni, Quadi and Sarmatians, while his able
general Theodosius cleared Britain of Picts, Scots and Saxons, and
<pb n="329"/><anchor id="Pg329"/>suppressed a dangerous revolt of the Moors in Africa. In 375
Valentinian died at Brigetio in the course of a war with the Sarmatians.
Although imperious and prone to violent outbursts of
temper, he had shown himself tireless in his efforts to protect the
empire from foreign foes and his subjects from official oppression.
In this latter aim, however, he was frequently thwarted by the intrigues
of his own officers.

<hi rend="bold">Gratian and Valentinian II.</hi> As early as 367 Valentinian had
appointed as a third Augustus his eldest son, Gratian, then only
seven years old. The latter now succeeded to the government of
the West, although the army also acclaimed as emperor his four-year-old
brother, Valentinian II.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Gothic invasion, 376 A. D.</hi> Meanwhile Valens, who exercised
the imperial power in the East, had been involved in protracted
struggles with the Goths along the lower Danube and with the Persians,
whose attempt to convert Armenia into a Persian province constituted
a threat too dangerous to be ignored. Peace had been established
with the Goths in 369, but in 376 new and unexpected developments
brought them again into conflict with the Romans.
</p>

<p>
The cause lay in the westward movement of the Huns, a nomadic
race of Mongolian origin, whose appearance in the regions to the
north of the Black Sea marks the beginning of the period of the
great migrations. In 375 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> they overwhelmed the Greuthungi, <anchor id="corr329"/><corr sic="o">or</corr>
East Goths, and assailed the Thervingi, or West Goths. Unable to
defend themselves, the latter in 376 sought permission to settle on
Roman territory to the south of the Danube. Valens acceded to their
request upon the condition of their giving up their weapons. The
reception and settlement of the Goths was entrusted to Roman officers
who neglected to enforce the surrender of their arms, while they
enriched themselves by extorting high prices from the immigrants
for the necessities of life. Thereupon, threatened by starvation, the
Goths rebelled, defeated the Romans, and began to plunder the country
(377 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). The news of this peril summoned Valens from the
East, but Gratian was hindered from coming to the rescue by an
incursion of the Alemanni into Gaul. However, as soon as he had
defeated the invaders he hastened to the assistance of his uncle.
Without awaiting his arrival, Valens rashly attacked the Goths at
Hadrianople. His army was cut to pieces, he himself slain, and
Goths overran the whole Balkan peninsula (378 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<pb n="330"/><anchor id="Pg330"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Theodosius I, the Great, 378 A. D.</hi> To meet this crisis, Gratian
appointed as Augustus, Theodosius, the son of the Theodosius who
had distinguished himself as a general under Valentinian I, but who
had fallen a victim to official intrigues at the latter’s death. The new
emperor undertook with vigor the task of clearing Thrace and the
adjoining provinces of the plundering hordes of Goths. By 382 he
had forced them to sue for peace and had settled them on waste lands
to the south of the Danube. There they remained as an independent
people under their native rulers, bound, however, to supply contingents
to the Roman armies in return for fixed subsidies. They thus became
imperial <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The revolt of Arbogast and Eugenius, 392 A. D.</hi> In 391 Theodosius
reduced the Goths to submission when a revolt of the troops
in Britain raised Magnus Maximus to the purple. Gratian had
shown himself a feeble administrator and had alienated the sympathies
of the bulk of his troops by his partiality towards the Germans
in his service. Maximus at once crossed into Gaul and was
confronted by Gratian at Paris. But the latter was deserted by his
army, and was captured and put to death. The authority of Maximus
was now firmly established in Britain, Gaul and Spain. He
demanded and received recognition from Theodosius, who was prevented
from avenging Gratian’s death by threatening conditions in
the East. The third Augustus, the young Valentinian II, acquired
for the time an independent sphere of authority in Italy. However,
in 387 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Maximus suddenly crossed the Alps and forced him to
take refuge with Theodosius. Having come to terms with Persia,
Theodosius refused to sanction the action of Maximus and marched
against him. The troops of Maximus were defeated, and he himself
captured and executed at <anchor id="corr330"/><corr sic="Aequileia">Aquileia</corr> (388 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Gaul and the
West were speedily recovered for Theodosius by his general, Arbogast.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Theodosius and Ambrose.</hi> While Theodosius was at Milan in
390 occurred his famous conflict with Bishop Ambrose. In a riot
at Thessalonica the commander of the garrison had been killed by
the mob, and Theodosius, in his anger, had turned loose the soldiery
upon the citizens, of whom seven thousand are said to have been
butchered. Scarcely had Theodosius issued the order when he was
seized with regret, and endeavored to countermand it; but it was too
late. Upon the news of the massacre, Ambrose excluded the emperor
from his church and refused to admit him to communion until he
<pb n="331"/><anchor id="Pg331"/>had publicly done penance for his sin. For eight months Theodosius
refused to yield, but Ambrose remained obdurate, and the emperor
finally humbled himself and publicly acknowledged his guilt. The
question at issue was not the supremacy of secular or religious authority,
but whether the emperor was subject to the same moral laws as
other men. Nevertheless, it required a high degree of courage for
the bishop to assert the right of the church to pass judgment in such
a matter upon the head of the state.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The revolt of Arbogast and Eugenius, 392 A. D.</hi> In 391 Theodosius
returned to the East, leaving Valentinian as emperor in the
West with his residence at Vienna in Gaul. But the powerful Arbogast,
whom Theodosius had placed in command of the western troops,
refused to act under the orders of the young Augustus, and finally
compassed his death (392 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). However, he did not dare, in view
of his Frankish origin, to assume the purple himself, and so induced
a prominent Roman official named Eugenius to accept the title of
Augustus. The authority of Eugenius was acknowledged in Italy
and all the West, but Theodosius refused him recognition and prepared
to crush the usurper. In the autumn of 394 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, at the river
Frigidus, near Aquileia, Theodosius won a complete victory over
Arbogast and Eugenius. The former committed suicide and the
latter was put to death.
</p>

<p>
Early in the next year Theodosius died, leaving the empire to his
two sons, Arcadius and Honorius, upon both of whom he had previously
conferred the rank of Augustus. The success of Theodosius
in coping with the Gothic peril and in suppressing the usurpers
Maximus and Eugenius, combined with his vigorous championship
of orthodox Christianity, won for him the title of the <q>Great.</q> With
the accession of Arcadius and Honorius and the permanent division
of the empire into an eastern and a western half, there begins a
new epoch of Roman history.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">I. The Autocrat and His Court</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Powers and titles of the emperor.</hi> The government of the late
Roman empire was an autocracy, in which the emperor was the
active head of the administration and at the same time the source of
all legislative, judicial and military authority. For the exercise of
this authority the support of the army and the bureaucracy was essential.
All the sovereign rights of the Roman people were regarded
as having been transferred to the imperial power. The emperor was
no longer the First of the Roman citizens—the <hi rend="italic">primus inter pares</hi>—but
all within the empire were in equal degree his subjects. This
view of the exalted status of the emperor was expressed in the
assumption of the divine titles Jovius and Herculius by Diocletian
and Maximian. Their Christian successors, although for the greater
part of the fourth century they accepted deification from their pagan
subjects, found a new basis for their absolutism in the conception of
the emperor as the elect of God, who ruled by divine guidance. Thus
the emperor could speak of the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> which had been conferred
upon him by the heavenly majesty. The adjectives <q>sacred</q> and
<q>divine</q> were applied not only to the emperor’s person but also to
everything that in any way belonged to him, and the <q>imperial divinity</q>
was an expression in common use.
</p>

<p>
As the sole author of the laws, the emperor was also their final
interpreter; and since he acted under divine guidance those who
questioned his decisions, and those who neglected or transgressed his
ordinances, were both alike guilty of sacrilege. The emperor was
held to be freed from the laws in the sense that he was not responsible
for his legislative and administrative acts, yet he was bound by the
laws in that he had to adhere to the general principles and forms of
the established law of the state, and had to abide by his own edicts,
for the imperial authority rested upon the authority of the laws.
</p>

<pb n="334"/><anchor id="Pg334"/>

<p>
The titles of the emperor bore witness to his autocratic power.
From the principate he had inherited those of Imperator, the significance
of which was revealed in its Greek rendering of Autocrator,
and Augustus, which was as well suited to the new as to the old
position of the emperor. More striking, however, was the use of
<hi rend="italic">dominus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dominus noster</hi>, a title which, as we have seen, was but
rarely used during the principate, but which was officially prescribed
by Diocletian. The term princeps, although it has long lost its original
significance, still continued to be employed in official documents,
at times in conjunction with <hi rend="italic">dominus</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Imperial regalia.</hi> The imperial regalia likewise expressed the
emperor’s autocratic power. With Diocletian the military garb of
the principate was discarded for a robe of silk interwoven with gold
and Constantine I introduced the use of the diadem, a narrow band
ornamented with jewels, which formed part of the insignia of the
Persian monarchs, and was symbolic of absolutism in the ancient
world.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The succession.</hi> We have seen how the scheme devised by Diocletian
for regulating the succession to the throne broke down after his
retirement. His successors refused to abdicate their imperial authority
and only surrendered it with life itself. In the appointment of
new emperors two principles found recognition—election and coöptation.
The system of election was a legacy from the principate, and
recourse was regularly had to it when the imperial throne was vacant.
The elected emperor was usually the choice of the leading military
and civil officials, approved by the army. In Constantinople, from
the fifth century at least, the nomination was made by these officers
in conjunction with the reorganized senate, and the new emperor was
proclaimed before the people assembled in the Hippodrome. The
emperors thus appointed claimed to have been elected by the officials,
the Senate, and the army with the sanction of the people. However,
as the history of the time shows, the right of election might be exercised
at any time, and a victorious usurper became a legal ruler.
Thus the autocracy, as has been aptly remarked, was tempered by a
legal right of revolution. As this method of election guaranteed a
high average of ability among emperors, so the custom of coöptation
gave opportunity to admit the claim of dynastic succession.
An Augustus could appoint as his colleague the one whom he wished
to succeed him on the throne. However, it is to be noted that a son
<pb n="335"/><anchor id="Pg335"/>who was thus elevated to the purple became emperor by virtue of his
father’s will and not by the right of birth.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The imperial court.</hi> Under Diocletian the organization and ceremonial
of the imperial palace were thoroughly remodelled. The
servants of the household—ushers, chamberlains, grooms and the
like—were now formed into corps on a military basis, with a definite
regulation of insignia, pay, term of service and promotion. In harmony
with the general spirit of the autocracy, the court ceremonial
was designed to widen the gulf between the ruler and his subjects and
to protect his person by rendering it inaccessible. Surrounded by
all the pomp and pageantry of an oriental potentate, the Roman
emperor was removed from contact with all but his immediate <hi rend="italic">entourage</hi>.
The effect of this seclusion was to enhance the power of the
few who were permitted to come into touch with him, in particular
the officials of the imperial household. The personal servants of the
emperor were placed on the same level as the public administrative
officers, and the most important of them, the grand chamberlain,
before the close of the fourth century had become one of the great
ministers of state, with a seat in the imperial cabinet. In conformity
with the assumption of the title <hi rend="italic">dominus</hi> and of the diadem, was the
requirement of prostration from all who were admitted to an audience
with the emperor. In addition to its civilian employees, the palace
had its special armed guard. These household troops were the
scholarians, organized by Constantine I when he disbanded the praetorian
guards who had upheld the cause of Maxentius.
</p>
        </div><div>
            <index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="II. The Military Organization"/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. The Military Organization</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">General characteristics.</hi> The chief characteristics of the military
organization of the late empire were the complete separation of civil
and military authority except in the person of the emperor, the sharp
distinction between the mobile forces and the frontier garrisons, and
the ever-increasing predominance of the barbarian element, not merely
in the rank and file of the soldiers, but also among the officers of
highest rank.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The limitanei.</hi> The troops composing the frontier garrisons were
called <hi rend="italic">limitanei</hi>, or borderers; also, when stationed along a river frontier,
<hi rend="italic">riparienses</hi>. They were the successors of the garrison army of
the principate and were distributed among small fortified posts
<pb n="336"/><anchor id="Pg336"/>(<hi rend="italic">castella</hi>). To each of these garrisons there was assigned for purposes
of cultivation a tract of land free from municipal authority.
These lands were exempt from taxation, and, although they were
not alienable, the right to occupy them passed from father to son
with the obligation to military service. Thus the <hi rend="italic">limitanei</hi> were
practically a border militia. Their numbers were materially increased
by Diocletian but reduced again by Constantine I who transferred
their best units to the field army. The <hi rend="italic">limitanei</hi> ranked below the
field troops; their physical standards were lower, and their rewards at
the end of their term of service inferior.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The palatini and comitatenses.</hi> To remedy the greatest weakness
in the army of the principate, namely, its lack of mobility,
Diocletian formed a permanent field force to accompany the emperor
on his campaigns, for it was his intention that the emperors should
personally lead their armies. Since the field troops thus formed the
<hi rend="italic">comitatus</hi>, or escort, of the emperor they received the name of <hi rend="italic">comitatenses</hi>.
Later certain units of the <hi rend="italic">comitatenses</hi> were called <hi rend="italic">palatini</hi>,
or palace troops, a purely honorary distinction. The <hi rend="italic">palatini</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">comitatenses</hi> were stationed at strategic points well within the frontiers.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Numbers.</hi> In both the garrison and field armies the old legion
was broken up into smaller detachments, to each of which the name
legion was given. They still continued to be recruited from Romans,
but were regarded as inferior in caliber to the <hi rend="italic">auxilia</hi>, the light infantry
corps which were largely drawn from barbarian volunteers.
A great number of new cavalry units were formed, so that the proportion
of cavalry to infantry was largely increased. At the opening
of the fifth century the troops stationed in Spain, in the Danubian
provinces, in the Orient and in Egypt had a nominal strength of
554,500 of which 360,000 were <hi rend="italic">limitanei</hi> and 194,500 field troops.
However, it is extremely doubtful if the separate detachments were
maintained at their full numbers. The scholarians, organized as an
imperial bodyguard by Constantine I, numbered 3500. They were
divided into seven companies called <hi rend="italic">scholae</hi>, from the fact that a
particular <hi rend="italic">schola</hi>, or waiting hall in the palace, was assigned to each.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Recruitment.</hi> In the late empire the ranks of the Roman army
stood open to all free men who possessed the requisite physical qualifications.
Slaves were also enrolled from the fifth century onwards
but their admission to military service brought them freedom. Recruits
were either volunteers or conscripts. The universal liability
<pb n="337"/><anchor id="Pg337"/>to service existed until the time of Valentinian I, although in practice
it was limited to the municipal plebs and the agricultural classes.
Valentinian placed the obligation to furnish a specified number of
recruits upon the landholders of certain provinces, and levied a corresponding
monetary tax upon the other provinces. He also made
it obligatory for the sons of soldiers to present themselves for service.
Many barbarian peoples, settled within the empire, were likewise
under an obligation to furnish a yearly number of recruits, who,
however, were regarded as volunteers. Still voluntary recruitment
was the rule under the late empire even more than under the
principate, and the majority of the volunteers for military service
were of barbarian origin. Corps of all sorts were named after barbarian
peoples, and while barbarian officers received Roman citizenship,
the rank and file remained aliens.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Discipline.</hi> The chief reason for the victories of the Roman armies
of the early principate over their barbarian foes lay in their superior
discipline and organization. And the burden of maintaining this
discipline had rested upon the junior officers or centurions who came
from the senatorial order of the Roman municipalities. By the end
of the third century the centuriate had disappeared for lack of volunteers
of this class and with its disappearance began a decline in
discipline and training. The construction of the fortified camp was
no longer required, the soldier’s heavy pack was discarded, and before
the close of the fourth century the burdensome defensive armor was
also given up. In equipment and tactics the Roman troops of the
late empire were on a level with their barbarian opponents. Just
as the Roman empire was unable to assimilate the barbarian settlers
within its frontiers, so the Roman army proved unable to absorb
the barbarian elements within its ranks.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Foederati.</hi> The decline in efficiency of the Roman troops and
the confessed inability of the state to deal with its military obligations
led to the taking into the Roman pay of warlike peoples along the
Roman frontiers. Such peoples were called federated allies (<hi rend="italic">foederati</hi>),
and guaranteed to protect the territory of the empire in return
for a stipulated remuneration in money or supplies. Such were the
terms upon which the Goths were granted lands south of the Danube
by Theodosius the Great. But in this case, as in others, it is hard to
distinguish between subsidies paid to <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi> and the payments
made by many emperors to purchase immunity from invasion by
<pb n="338"/><anchor id="Pg338"/>dangerous neighbors. A danger inherent in the system was that the
<hi rend="italic">foederati</hi> might at any moment turn their arms against their employers.
Retaining as they did their political autonomy and serving
under their own chiefs, the <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi> were not regarded as forming a
part of the imperial forces.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The duces and the magistri militum.</hi> We have already referred
to the complete separation of military and civil authority.
This was carried out as far as the border troops were concerned by
Diocletian. He divided the frontiers into military districts which
corresponded to the provinces and placed the garrisons in each under
an officer with the title of <hi rend="italic">dux</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">duces</hi> of highest rank were regularly
known as <hi rend="italic">comites</hi> (counts). Under Diocletian the praetorian
prefects remained the highest military officers, and were in command
of the field army. As we have seen, Constantine I deprived the praetorian
prefecture of its military functions and appointed two new
commanders-in-chief—the master of the foot (<hi rend="italic">magister peditum</hi>)
and the master of the horse (<hi rend="italic">magister equitum</hi>). Under the successors
of Constantine these offices were increased in number and the
distinction between infantry and cavalry commands was abandoned.
Consequently, the titles of master of the horse and master of the
foot were altered to those of masters of horse and foot, masters of
each service, or masters of the soldiers. In the East by the close
of the fourth century there were two masters of the soldiers at Constantinople,
each commanding half of the palatini in the vicinity of
the capital, and three others commanding the <hi rend="italic">comitatenses</hi> in the
Orient, Thrace and Illyricum, respectively. In the West there were
two masterships at the court, and a master of the horse in the diocese
of Gaul.
</p>

<p>
But while in the East the several masters of the soldiers enjoyed
independent commands, in the West by 395 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> there had developed
a concentration of the supreme military power in the hands of one
master, who united in his person the two masterships at the court.
The master in Gaul, with the <hi rend="italic">duces</hi> and <hi rend="italic">comites</hi> in the provinces were
under his orders. This subordination was emphasized by the fact
that the heads of the office staff (<hi rend="italic">principes</hi>) of the <hi rend="italic">comites</hi> and <hi rend="italic">duces</hi>
were appointed by the master at the court. On the other hand, in the
East, these <hi rend="italic">principes</hi> were appointed by a civil official, the master of
the offices, who was also charged with the inspection of the frontier
defences, and from the opening of the fifth century exercised judicial
<pb n="339"/><anchor id="Pg339"/>authority over the <hi rend="italic">duces</hi>. The latter, however, remained the military
subordinates of the masters of the soldiers. Thus the concentration
of military power in the West in the hands of a single commander-in-chief
prepared the way for the rise of the king-makers of the fifth
century, while the division of the higher command in the East prevented
a single general from completely dominating the political
situation.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Judicial status of the soldiers.</hi> Characteristic of the times was
the removal of soldiers from the jurisdiction of the civil authority.
In the fourth century they could only be prosecuted on criminal charges
in the courts of their military commanders, and in the fifth century
they were granted this privilege in civil cases also.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. The Perfection of the Bureaucracy</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The administrative divisions of the empire.</hi> The administrative
machinery of the late empire was simply an outgrowth from,
and a more complete form of, the bureaucracy which had developed
under the principate. All the officers of the state were now servants
of the emperor, appointed by him and dismissed at his pleasure.
At the basis of the administrative organization lay the division of the
empire into prefectures, dioceses and provinces. By the close of the
fourth century there were one hundred and twenty provinces, grouped
into fourteen dioceses, which made up the four prefectures of Gaul,
Italy, Illyricum and the Orient.<note place="foot">The distribution of the dioceses among the prefectures was as follows:
            <list>
                <item>Prefecture of Gaul—dioceses of Britain, Gaul, Spain;</item>
                <item>Prefecture of Italy—suburban diocese of the city of Rome, and the dioceses of Italy, Africa, Illyricum;</item>
                <item>Prefecture of Illyricum—dioceses of Eastern Illyricum, Thrace, Macedonia;</item>
                <item>Prefecture of the Orient—dioceses of Asia, Pontus, the Orient and Egypt.</item>
            </list></note> This division of the empire into
four prefectures was carried out under Constans and Constantius.
Until the death of Constantine I, the pretorian prefecture had remained
an office associated with the person of the emperor, and from
the time of Diocletian the number of praetorian prefects had corresponded
to the number of Augusti, each emperor appointing one for
his own part of the empire. This practice was followed by the sons
of Constantine. But after Constans had overthrown Constantine II
he left the latter’s territory under the administration of a special
prefect, thus establishing the prefecture of Gaul. He afterwards
appointed another prefect for Illyricum, which was separated from
<pb n="340"/><anchor id="Pg340"/>the jurisdiction of the prefect of Italy. When Constantius became
sole emperor in 351, he retained the three prefectures of Constans,
and his own previous dominions constituted the fourth, that of the
Orient. In 379, Gratian, the emperor in the West, transferred the
Illyrian prefecture from his sphere to that of Theodosius, his colleague
in the East.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The praetorian prefects and their subordinates.</hi> Each province
had a civil governor, variously known as proconsul, consular, <hi rend="italic">corrector</hi>
or <hi rend="italic">praeses</hi>, according to the relative importance of his governorship.
The provincial governors, with a few exceptions, were subject to the
vicars, who were in charge of the several dioceses, and who, in turn,
were under the administrative control of the four praetorian prefects,
the heads of the prefectures. The prefects and their subordinates
were in charge of the raising of taxes paid in kind and of the administration
of justice for the provincials. Italy was now divided into
several provinces and Italian soil was no longer exempt from taxation.
With the exception of the population of Rome, the inhabitants of
Italy were upon the same footing as those of the other provinces,
with whom they shared the name of provincials.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The central administrative bureaus.</hi> The remaining branches
of the civil administration were directed by a group of ministers
resident at the court, with subordinates in the various administrative
departments. These ministers were the master of the offices, the
quaestor, the count of the sacred largesses and the count of the
private purse. The master of the offices united in his hands the
control of the secretarial bureaus of the palace, the oversight over
the public post, the direction of the <hi rend="italic">agentes-in-rebus</hi>, who constituted
the imperial secret service, the command of the scholarians, the supervision
of several branches of the palace administration, and jurisdiction
over practically all of the personal servants of the emperor. As
we have seen, in the East he also exercised certain authority over the
<hi rend="italic">duces</hi>. The quaestor (to be distinguished from the holders of the
urban quaestorships) was a minister of justice, part of whose duties
consisted in the preparation of imperial legislation. The count of
the sacred largesses was the successor to the <hi rend="italic">rationalis</hi>, who had been
in charge of the imperial fiscus under the principate. He was
charged with the collection and disbursement of the public revenues
which were paid in money, and his title was derived from the fact
that the funds under his control were used for the imperial donations
<pb n="341"/><anchor id="Pg341"/>or largesses. He likewise had the supervision of the imperial factories
engaged in the manufacture of silks, and other textiles. The
count of the private purse was the head of the department of the
<hi rend="italic">res privata</hi> and in charge of the revenues from the imperial domains.
These ministers with certain other administrative officials of the court
and the chief officers of the imperial household, such as the grand
chamberlain, were known as the palace dignitaries (<hi rend="italic">dignitates palatinae</hi>).
</p>

<p>
Rome and Constantinople were exempt from the authority of the
praetorian prefects, and were each administered by a city prefect.
Two consuls were nominated annually, one at Rome and one at Constantinople,
and gave their names to the official year, but their duties
were limited to furnishing certain entertainments for the populace of
the capitals. This was also the sole function of the praetorship and
quaestorship, which were now filled by imperial appointment upon
the recommendation of the city prefects.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The imperial council of state.</hi> The system of graded subordination,
which placed the lower officials in each department under the
orders of those having wider powers, brought about the ultimate concentration
of the civil and military administration in the hands of
about twenty officers who were directly in touch with the emperor
and responsible to him alone. From these were drawn the members
of the council of state or imperial consistory (so-called from the
obligation to remain standing in the presence of the emperor). Permanent
members of this council were the four ministers of the court
mentioned above, who were known as the counts of the consistory,
and also the grand chamberlain.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The officia.</hi> The officials who were at the head of administrative
departments, civil or military, had at their disposal an <hi rend="italic">officium</hi> or
bureau, the members of which were known as <hi rend="italic">officiales</hi>. These subaltern
employees of the state were free men, no longer slaves or freedmen
like their predecessors of the principate. As in the case of the
palace servants their numbers, terms of service (<hi rend="italic">militia</hi>), promotion
and discharge were fixed by imperial edicts, and they were not placed
at the mercy of the functionary whose office staff they formed. Indeed,
owing to the permanent character of the organization of the
<hi rend="italic">officia</hi>, the burden of the routine administration fell upon their members,
and not upon their temporary director, for whose acts they were
made to share the responsibility. This was particularly true of the
<pb n="342"/><anchor id="Pg342"/>bureau chief (<hi rend="italic">princeps</hi>), who was regularly appointed from the
<hi rend="italic">agentes-in-rebus</hi> as a spy upon the actions of his superior. Like the
soldiers, the civil service employees enjoyed exemption from the ordinary
courts of justice and the privilege of defending themselves in the
courts of the chief of that branch of the administration to which they
were attached.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Official corruption.</hi> The attitude of the emperor towards his chief
servants was marked by mistrust and suspicion. The policy which
led to the attempt to weaken the more powerful offices by the separation
of civil and military authority and by the subdivision of the
administrative districts was adhered to in the provisions for direct
communication between the emperor and the subordinates of the great
ministers, and the highly developed system of state espionage whereby
the ruler kept watch upon the actions of his officers. However, in
spite of the efforts of the majority of the emperors to secure an honest
and efficient administration, the actual result of the development of
this elaborate bureaucratic system was the erection of an almost impassable
barrier between the emperor and his subjects. Neither did
their complaints reach his ears, nor were his ordinances for their
relief effective, because the officials coöperated with one another to
conceal their misdemeanors and to enrich themselves at the expense
of the civilian population. So thoroughly had the spirit of <q>graft</q>
and intrigue penetrated all ranks of the civil and military service that
to gratify their personal ambitions they were even willing to compromise
the safety of the empire itself. The burden imposed upon the
tax payers by the vast military and civil establishment was immensely
aggravated by the extortions practised by representatives of both services,
whose rapacity knew no bounds.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">IV. The Nobility and the Senate</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The senatorial order.</hi> The conflict between the principate and
the Senate resulted, as we have seen, in the exclusion of members of
the senatorial order from all offices of state. But it was unthinkable
that the great landed proprietors should be permanently shut out of
the public service, and with the loss of any claim to authority by the
Senate as a body there was no longer any objection to their entering
the service of the emperor. Consequently, the essential distinction
be<pb n="343"/><anchor id="Pg343"/>tween the senatorial and equestrian orders vanished and a new senatorial
order arose into which was merged a large equestrian element.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The clarissimate.</hi> The distinguishing mark of this new senatorial
order was the right to the title <hi rend="italic">clarissimus</hi>, which might be acquired
by inheritance, by imperial grant, or by the attainment of an office
which conferred the clarissimate upon its holder, either during his
term of service or upon his retirement. Practically all of the higher
officials in the imperial service were <hi rend="italic">clarissimi</hi> and there was consequently
a great increase in the number of senators in the course of
the fourth century. The place of the equestrian order was in part
filled by the <anchor id="corr343"/><corr sic="prefectissimate">perfectissimate</corr>, an inferior order of rank conferred upon
lower imperial officials and municipal senators.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The higher orders of rank.</hi> The development of an oriental
court life with its elaborate ceremonial demanding a fixed order of
precedence among those present at imperial audiences, and the increase
in the number and importance of the public officials, which
necessitated a classification of the various official posts from the point
of view of rank, led to the establishment of new and more exclusive
rank classes within the circle of the <hi rend="italic">clarissimi</hi>. There were in the
ascending order the <hi rend="italic">spectabiles</hi>, or Respectables, and the <hi rend="italic">illustres</hi>, or
Illustrious. The illustriate was conferred solely upon the great ministers
of state. Under Justinian, in the sixth century, there was established
the still higher order of the <hi rend="italic">gloriosi</hi> (the Glorious). The
official positions, to which these titles of rank were attached, were
called dignities (<hi rend="italic">dignitates</hi>), and the great demand for admission to
these rank classes, which entitled their members to valuable privileges,
caused the conferment of many honorary dignities, i. e., titles of
official posts with their appropriate rank but without the duties of
office.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The patricians and counts.</hi> The other titles of nobility were
those of patrician and count. The former, created by Constantine I
in imitation of the older patrician order, was granted solely to the
highest dignitaries, although it was not attached to any definite official
post. It was Constantine also who revived the <hi rend="italic">comitiva</hi>, which had
been used irregularly of the chief associates of the princeps until the
death of Severus Alexander, and put it to a new use. The term count
became a title of honor definitely attached to certain offices, but also
capable of being conferred as a favor or a reward of merit. Like the
<pb n="344"/><anchor id="Pg344"/>other titles of rank the patriciate and the <hi rend="italic">comitiva</hi> brought with them
not only precedence but also valuable immunities.
</p>

<p>
Nothing illustrates more clearly the importance of official positions
than the division of the people of the empire as a whole into two
classes—the <hi rend="italic">honestiores</hi> (more honorable) and the <hi rend="italic">humiliores</hi> (more
humble or plebeians). The former class, which included the imperial
senators, the soldiers and the veterans, were exempt from execution
except with the emperor’s consent, from penal servitude, and,
with some limitations, from torture in the course of judicial investigations.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Senate.</hi> The Senate at Rome was not abolished but continued
to function both as a municipal council and as the mouthpiece
of the senatorial order. After the founding of Constantinople a
similar Senate was established there for the eastern part of the empire.
At first all <hi rend="italic">clarissimi</hi> had a right to participate in the meetings
of the Senate, and their sons were expected to fill the quaestorship.
However, after the middle of the fifth century only those having the
rank of <hi rend="italic">illustris</hi> were admitted to the senate chamber, and the active
Senate became a gathering of the highest officials and ex-officials of
the state. In addition to their functions as municipal councils, the
Senates made recommendations for the quaestorship and praetorship,
discussed with the imperial officials the taxes which affected the
senatorial order and even participated to a certain extent in drafting
imperial legislation.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The senators and the municipalities.</hi> The most important
privilege enjoyed by the senators was their exemption from the control
of the officials of the municipalities within whose territories their
estates were situated. As we shall see, this was one of the chief reasons
for the extension of their power in the provinces.
</p>
        </div><div>
<index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="V. The System of Taxation and the Ruin of the Municipalities"/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">V. The System of Taxation and the Ruin of the
Municipalities</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The system of taxation.</hi> The debasement of the Roman coinage
in the course of the third century resulted in a thorough disorganization
of the public finances, for the taxes and disbursements fixed in
terms of money had no longer their previous value. Diocletian completely
reorganized the financial system by introducing a general
scheme of taxation and remuneration in produce in place of <anchor id="corr344"/><corr sic="coin.">coin,</corr>
<pb n="345"/><anchor id="Pg345"/>and by establishing a new method of assessment. This latter consisted
in the division of the land, cattle and agricultural labor into
units of equal tax value. The unit of taxation for land was the
<hi rend="italic">iugum</hi>, which differed in size for arable land, vineyards and orchards,
as well as for soils of varying fertility. A fixed number of cattle
likewise constituted a <hi rend="italic">iugum</hi>, assessed at the same value as a <hi rend="italic">iugum</hi>
of land. The unit of labor, regarded as the equivalent of the <hi rend="italic">iugum</hi>
was the <hi rend="italic">caput</hi>, which was defined as one man or two women engaged
in agricultural occupations. Thus the workers were taxed in addition
to the land they tilled.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The indiction.</hi> The amount of the land tax to be raised each year
was announced in an annual proclamation called an indiction (<hi rend="italic">indictio</hi>),
and a revaluation of the tax units was made periodically.
The term indiction was also used of the period between two reassessments,
which occurred at first every five, but after 312 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> every
fifteen, years. The indictions thus furnished the basis for a new
system of chronology. From the taxes raised in kind the soldiers
and those in the civil service received their pay in the form of an allowance
(<hi rend="italic">annona</hi>), which might under certain conditions be commuted
for its monetary equivalent.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Special taxes.</hi> In addition to the land tax raised in the form of
produce on the basis of the <hi rend="italic">iuga</hi> and <hi rend="italic">capita</hi>, there were certain other
taxes payable in money. The chief of these were: the <hi rend="italic">chrysargyrum</hi>,
a tax levied on all trades; the <hi rend="italic">aurum coronarium</hi>, a nominally voluntary
but really compulsory contribution paid by the municipal senators
every five years to enable the emperor to distribute largesses to
his officials and troops; the <hi rend="italic">aurum oblaticium</hi>, a similar payment
made by the senatorial order of the empire; and the <hi rend="italic">collatio glebalis</hi>
or <hi rend="italic">follis senatoria</hi>, a special tax imposed upon senators by Constantine
I.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Munera.</hi> Besides the taxes, the government laid upon its subjects
the burden of performing certain public services without compensation.
The most burdensome of these charges (<hi rend="italic">munera</hi>) were the
upkeep of the public post, and the furnishing of quarters (<hi rend="italic">hospitium</hi>)
and rendering other services in connection with the movement of
troops, officials and supplies. So heavy was the burden of the post
that it denuded of draught animals the districts it traversed and had
to be abandoned in the sixth century. It was in connection with the
exaction of these charges, the collection of the revenue in kind, and in
<pb n="346"/><anchor id="Pg346"/>the administration of justice that the imperial officials found opportunity
to practice extortions which weighed more heavily upon the
taxpayers than the taxes themselves.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The curiales.</hi> The class which suffered most directly from the
established fiscal system was that of the <hi rend="italic">curiales</hi>, as the members of
the municipal senatorial orders were now called. In the course of
the third century the status of <hi rend="italic">curialis</hi> had become hereditary, and
was an obligation upon all who possessed a definite property qualification,
fixed at twenty-five <hi rend="italic">iugera</hi> of land in the fourth century.
Since the local senates had become agents of the <hi rend="italic">fiscus</hi> in collecting
the revenues from their municipal territories, the <hi rend="italic">curiales</hi>, through
the municipal officers or committees of the local council, had to apportion
the quotas of the municipal burden among the landholders, to
collect them, and be responsible for the payment of the total amount
to the public officers. They were also responsible for the maintenance
of the public post and the performance of other services resting
upon the municipalities. Inevitably the <hi rend="italic">curiales</hi> sought to protect
themselves by shifting the burden of taxation as much as possible
upon the lower classes in the municipal territory who regarded them
as oppressors. <q>Every <hi rend="italic">curialis</hi> is a tyrant</q> (<hi rend="italic">quot curiales, tot
tyranni</hi>), says a fourth century writer.
</p>

<p>
The exactions of the imperial officers proved more than the <hi rend="italic">curiales</hi>
could meet, and they sought to withdraw from their order and its
obligations. But the government required responsible landholders
and so they were forbidden to dispose of their properties or to leave
their place of residence without special permission. And when they
tried to find exemption by entering the imperial senatorial order, the
military or civil service, or the clergy, these avenues of escape were
likewise closed. Only those who had filled all the municipal offices
might become <hi rend="italic">clarissimi</hi> and immune from the curial obligations, and
only clergy of the rank of bishops were excused, while the lower orders
had to supply a substitute or surrender two-thirds of their
property before they could leave the <hi rend="italic">curia</hi>. Valentinian I attempted
to aid the <hi rend="italic">curiales</hi> by appointing officials known as
    <hi rend="italic">defensores <anchor id="corr346"/><corr sic="civatatium">civitatium</corr></hi>
or <hi rend="italic">plebis</hi>—<q>defenders of the cities</q> or <q>of the plebs</q>—whose
duty it was to check unjust exactions and protect the common
people against officials and judges. These <hi rend="italic">defensores</hi> were at first
persons of influence, chosen by the municipalities and approved by
<pb n="347"/><anchor id="Pg347"/>the emperor. They were empowered to try certain cases themselves,
and had the right to address themselves directly to the emperor without
reference to the provincial governor. However, the <hi rend="italic">defensores</hi> accomplished little, and in the fifth century their office had become
an additional obligatory service resting upon the <hi rend="italic">curiales</hi>. By 429
<hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> hardly a <hi rend="italic">curialis</hi> with adequate property qualifications could be
found in any city, and by the sixth century the class of municipal
landholders had practically disappeared.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The hereditary corporations.</hi> We have seen how, in the course
of the third century, the professional corporations were burdened
with the duty of performing certain public services in the interest of
the communities to which they belonged. The first step taken by the
state to insure the performance of these services was to make this
duty a charge which rested permanently upon the property of the
members of the corporations (<hi rend="italic">corporati</hi>), no matter into whose possession
it passed. But men as well as money were needed for the
performance of these charges, and consequently, in order to prevent
a decline in the numbers of the <hi rend="italic">corporati</hi>, the state made membership
in these associations an hereditary obligation. This was really an
extension of the principle that a man was bound to perform certain
services in the community in which he was enrolled (his <hi rend="italic">origo</hi>). Finally,
the emperors exercised the right of conscription, and attached to
the various corporations which were in need of recruits persons who
were engaged in less needed occupations.
</p>

<p>
The burden of their charges led the <hi rend="italic">corporati</hi>, like the <hi rend="italic">curiales</hi>,
to seek refuge in some other profession. They tried to secure enrollment
in the army, among the <hi rend="italic">officiales</hi>, or to become <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> of the
emperor or senatorial landholders. But all these havens of refuge
were closed by imperial edicts, and when discovered the truant <hi rend="italic">corporatus</hi>
was dragged back to his association. Only those who attained
the highest office within their corporation were legally freed
from their obligations.
</p>

<p>
Although the corporations probably retained their former organization
and officers, their active heads were now called <hi rend="italic">patroni</hi>, and these
directed the public services of their colleges. In Rome and Constantinople
the colleges were under the supervision of the city prefects, in
the municipalities under that of the local magistrates and provincial
governors. The professional colleges are the only ones which
sur<pb n="348"/><anchor id="Pg348"/>vived during the late empire. The religious and funerary associations
vanished with the spread of Christianity and the general impoverishment
of the lower classes.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The coloni.</hi> Among the agricultural classes the forces which had
developed in the course of the principate were still at work. In the
fourth century the attachment of the tenant farmers and peasant laborers
to the soil was extended to the whole empire. The status of the
<hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> became hereditary, like that of the <hi rend="italic">corporati</hi>. Their condition
was half way between that of freedmen and that of slaves, for while
they were bound to the estate upon which they resided and passed
with it from one owner to another, they were not absolutely under the
power of the owner and could not be disposed of by him apart from
the land. They had also other rights which slaves lacked, yet as
time went on their condition tended to approximate more and more
closely to servitude. <q>Slaves of the soil,</q> they were called in the
sixth century. As this status of serfdom was hitherto unknown in
Roman law, a great many imperial enactments had to be issued
defining the rights and duties of the <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The growth of private domains.</hi> The development of vast private
estates at the expense of the public and imperial domains was
another prominent characteristic of the times. This was the result
of the failure of the state to check the spread of waste lands, in spite
of its attempt to develop the system of hereditary leaseholds to small
farmers. To maintain the level of production the government opened
the way for the great proprietors to take over all deserted lands under
various forms of heritable lease or in freehold tenure. The system
of attaching waste lands to those of the neighboring landholders and
making the latter responsible for their cultivation was an added cause
of the growth of large estates. The result of this development was
that the state tenants became <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> of the great landlords, and the
latter were responsible for the taxes and other obligations of their
<hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> to the state. The weight of these obligations rested as before
upon the <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi>, and led to their continued flight and a further increase
in waste land. Like the <hi rend="italic">curiales</hi> and <hi rend="italic">corporati</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi>
tried to exchange their status by entering the public service or attaining
admission to some other social class. But, in like manner also,
they found themselves excluded from all other occupations and classes.
Only the fugitive <hi rend="italic">colonus</hi> who had managed to remain undetected for
<pb n="349"/><anchor id="Pg349"/>thirty years (in the case of women twenty years) could escape being
handed back to the land which he had deserted.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The power of the landed nobility.</hi> The immunities of the senatorial
order and the power of the high officials tended to give an almost
feudal character to the position of the great landed proprietors.
These had inherited the judicial powers of the procurators on the
imperial estates and transferred this authority to their own domains.
Over their slaves and <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> they exercised the powers of police and
jurisdiction. As they were not subject to the municipal authorities,
and, during the greater part of the fourth century, were also exempt
from the jurisdiction of the provincial governors they assumed a very
independent position, and did not hesitate to defy the municipal
magistrates and even the minor agents of the imperial government.
Their power made their protection extremely valuable, and led to a
new type of patronage. Individuals and village communities, desirous
of escaping from the exactions to which they were subject in
their municipal districts, placed themselves under the patronage of
some senatorial landholder and became his tenants. And he did not
hesitate to afford them an illegal protection against the local authorities.
Complaints by the latter to higher officials secured little redress
for they were themselves proprietors and sided with those of
their own class. The power of the state was thus nullified by its
chief servants and the landed aristocracy became the heirs of the
empire.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Resumé.</hi> The transformation which society underwent during the
empire may be aptly described as the transition from a régime of individual
initiative to a régime of status, that is, from one in which
the position of an individual in society was mainly determined by
his own volition to one in which this was fixed by the accident of his
birth. The population of the empire was divided into a number of
sharply defined castes, each of which was compelled to play a definite
rôle in the life of the state. The sons of senators, soldiers, <hi rend="italic">curiales</hi>,
<hi rend="italic">corporati</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> had to follow in their fathers’ walks of life, and
each sought to escape from the tasks to which he was born. In the
eyes of the government <hi rend="italic">collegiati</hi>, <hi rend="italic">curiales</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> existed solely
to pay taxes for the support of the bureaucracy and the army. The
consequence was the attempted flight of the population to the army,
civil service, the church or the wilderness. Private industry
lan<pb n="350"/><anchor id="Pg350"/>guished, commerce declined, the fields lay untilled; a general feeling
of hopelessness paralyzed all initiative. And when the barbarians
began to occupy the provinces they encountered no national resistance;
rather were they looked upon as deliverers from the burdensome
yoke of Rome.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">I. General Characteristics of the Period</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The partition of the empire.</hi> With the death of Theodosius the
Great the empire passed to his sons, Arcadius a youth of eighteen,
whom he had left in Constantinople, and Honorius a boy of eleven,
whom he had designated as the Augustus for the West. However,
in the East the government was really in the hands of Rufinus, the
pretorian prefect of Illyricum, while an even greater influence was
exercised in the West by Stilicho, the Vandal master of the soldiers,
whom Theodosius had selected as regent for the young Honorius.
The rivalry of these two ambitious men, and the attempt of Stilicho
to secure for Honorius the restoration of eastern Illyricum, which had
been attached by Gratian to the sphere of the eastern emperor, were
the immediate causes of the complete and formal division of the
empire into an eastern and a western half, a condition which had
been foreshadowed by the division of the imperial power throughout
the greater part of the fourth century.
</p>

<p>
The fiction of imperial unity was still preserved by the nomination
of one consul in Rome and one in Constantinople, by the association of
the statues of both Augusti in each part of the empire, and by the
issuance of imperial enactments under their joint names. Nevertheless,
there was a complete separation of administrative authority, the
edicts issued by one emperor required the sanction of the other before
attaining validity within his territory, and upon the death of one
Augustus the actual government of the whole empire did not pass into
the hands of the survivor. The empire had really split into two independent
states.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Germanic invasions.</hi> In addition to the partition of the
empire, the period between 395 and 493 is marked by the complete
breakdown of the Roman resistance to barbarian invasions, and the
penetration and occupation of the western provinces and Italy itself
<pb n="352"/><anchor id="Pg352"/>by peoples of Germanic stock. The position of Roman and barbarian
is reversed; the latter become the rulers, the former their subjects,
and the power passes from the Roman officials to the Germanic
kings. Finally, a barbarian soldier seats himself upon the throne
of the western emperor, and a Germanic kingdom is established in
Italy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The military dictators.</hi> During this period of disintegration, the
real power in the western empire was in the hands of a series of
military dictators, who with the office of master of the soldiers secured
the position of commander-in-chief of the imperial armies.
Beside them the emperors exercised only nominal authority. But as
these dictators were either barbarians themselves, or depended upon
barbarian troops for their support, they were continually intrigued
against and opposed by the Roman or civilian element, headed by the
civil officers of the court. Yet the fall of one <q>kingmaker</q> was
always followed by the rise of another, for by their aid alone could
the Romans offer any effective resistance to the flood of barbarian invasion.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The empire maintained in the East.</hi> But while the western
empire was thus absorbed by the Germanic invaders, the empire in
the East was able to offer a successful resistance both to foreign invasions
and the ambitions of its own barbarian generals. This is in
part accounted for by the greater solidarity and vigor of the Hellenic
civilization of the eastern provinces, and the military strength of the
population, particularly in Asia Minor, and in part by the success of
the bureaucracy in holding the generals in check, a task which was
facilitated by the division of the supreme military authority among
several masters of the soldiers. The strength of the eastern empire
caused the West to look to it for support and the western emperors
upon several occasions were nominated, and at other times given the
sanction of legitimacy, by those in the East.

by the death of Theodosius and the absence of the army of the
East which he had led into Italy, Alaric, a prince of the Visigothic
<hi rend="italic">foederati</hi>, began to ravage Thrace and Macedonia with a band of his
own people, aided by other tribes from across the Danube. He was
<pb n="353"/><anchor id="Pg353"/>opposed by Stilicho who was leading back the troops of the eastern
emperor and intended to occupy eastern Illyricum. However, the
latter was ordered by Arcadius to send the army of the East to Constantinople
and complied. This gave Alaric free access to southern
Greece which he systematically plundered. However, Stilicho again
intervened. He transported an army by sea to the Peloponnesus, and
maneuvered Alaric into a precarious situation, but came to terms with
him, possibly because of a revolt which had broken out in Africa.
Stilicho was declared an enemy by Arcadius, while Alaric, after
devastating Epirus, settled there with his Goths, and extorted the
title of <hi rend="italic">magister militum</hi> from the eastern court.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The death of Stilicho, 408 A. D.</hi> In 401 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, when Stilicho
was occupied with an inroad of Vandals and Alans into Raetia,
Alaric invaded Italy. However, Stilicho forced him to withdraw, and
foiled a second attempt at invasion in 403 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> But Alaric did not
long remain inactive. He now held the title of master of the soldiers
from Honorius and had agreed to help Stilicho to accomplish his
designs upon Illyricum. But when the western empire was embarrassed
by new invasions and the appearance of a usurper in Gaul,
he made his way into Noricum and demanded an indemnity and
employment for his troops. By the advice of Stilicho his demands,
which included a payment of 4000 pounds of gold, were complied
with. Shortly afterwards, Stilicho fell a victim to a plot hatched by
the court officials who were jealous of his influence (408 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Visigoths in Italy.</hi> The death of Stilicho removed the only
capable defender of Italy and, when Honorius refused to carry out
the agreement with Alaric, the latter crossed the Alps. Honorius
shut himself up in Ravenna, and the Goths marched on Rome, which
ransomed itself at a heavy price. As Honorius still refused to make
him master of the soldiers and to give him lands and supplies for his
men, Alaric returned to Rome and set up a new emperor, named
Attalus. Yet Honorius, supported by troops from the eastern empire,
remained obdurate, and a disagreement between Alaric and Attalus
led to the latter’s deposition. Rome was then occupied by the Goths
who plundered it for three days (410 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Alaric’s next move was
to march to south Italy with the intention of crossing to Sicily and
Africa. But his flotilla was destroyed by a storm, and while retracing
his steps northwards he suddenly took sick and died.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Goths in Gaul and Spain.</hi> Alaric’s successor was his
brother-in-law, Ataulf, who led the Visigoths into Gaul (412 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>),
<pb n="354"/><anchor id="Pg354"/>where he at first allied himself with a usurper, Jovinus, but soon
deserted him to take service with the Romans. However, when
Honorius failed to furnish him supplies, he seized Narbonne and
other towns in southern Gaul and married the emperor’s sister, Placidia,
whom the Goths had carried off captive from Rome. He again
attempted to come to terms with the Romans, but failed, and Constantius,
the Roman master of the soldiers, who had succeeded to the
position and influence of Stilicho, forced him to abandon Gaul.
Ataulf and the Goths crossed the Pyrenees into Spain, where he died
in 415 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> His successor Wallia, being hard pressed by famine and
failing in an attempt to invade Africa, came to terms with the Romans.
He surrendered Placidia and in the name of the emperor attacked the
Vandals and Alans who had occupied parts of Spain. Alarmed by
his success Constantius recalled the Goths to Gaul, where they were
settled in southern Aquitania (418 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Visigothic kingdom in Gaul.</hi> The status of the Goths in
Gaul was that of <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi>, bound to render military aid to Rome,
but governed by their own kings. The latter, however, had no authority
over the Roman population among whom the Goths were settled.
This condition was unsatisfactory to the Gothic rulers who
sought to establish an independent Gothic kingdom. Theodoric I,
the successor of Wallia, forced the Romans to acknowledge his complete
sovereignty over Aquitania, but failed in his attempt to conquer
Narbonese Gaul. However, he joined forces with the Romans against
Attila the Hun and was largely responsible for checking the latter at
the battle of the Mauriac plain (451 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>) in which he lost his life.
For a time the Goths remained on friendly terms with the imperial
authority but under Euric, who became king in 466 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, the anti-Roman
faction was in the ascendant and they embarked upon a policy
of expansion. In 475 Euric, after a protracted struggle, gained possession
of the district of Auvergne, and the Roman emperor acknowledged
his sovereignty over the country between the Atlantic and the
Rhone, the Loire and the Pyrenees, besides some territory in Spain.
Two years later the district between the Rhone and the Alps, south
of the Durance, was added to the Visigothic kingdom.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The invasions of 406 A. D.</hi> In 405 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> an invading horde of
<pb n="355"/><anchor id="Pg355"/>Vandals and Alans, who had descended upon Italy, was utterly defeated
by Stilicho. But in the following year fresh swarms of the
same peoples, united with the Suevi, crossed the Rhine near Mainz
and plundered Gaul as far as the Pyrenees. For a short time they
were held in check by the usurper Constantine, who held sway in
Gaul and Spain. However, when he was involved in a struggle with
a rival, Gerontius, they found an opportunity to make their way into
Spain (409 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The occupation of Spain.</hi> The united peoples speedily made
themselves masters of the whole Iberian peninsula. But in spite of
their successes over the Roman troops, the lack of supplies forced
them to come to terms with the empire. In 411 they became Roman
<hi rend="italic">foederati</hi> and were granted lands for settlement. Under this agreement
the Asdingian Vandals and the Suevi occupied the northwest
of Spain, the Alans the center, and the Silingian Vandals the south.
However, the Roman government had only made peace with the Vandals
and their allies under pressure, and seized the first opportunity
to rid themselves of these unwelcome guests. In 416 Constantius
authorized the Visigoths under Wallia to attack them in the name of
the emperor. Wallia was so successful that he utterly annihilated the
Silingian Vandals, and so weakened the Alans that they united themselves
with the Asdingian Vandals, who escaped destruction only
through the recall of the Visigoths to Gaul. However, the Vandals
quickly recovered from their defeats, waged successful war upon the
Suevi, who had reached an agreement with the Romans, and occupied
the whole of southern Spain.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Vandal kingdom in Africa.</hi> In 429 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> the Vandals under
the leadership of their king Gaiseric crossed into Africa, attracted by
the richness of its soil and its strategic importance as one of the
granaries of the Roman world. Their invasion was facilitated by
the existence of a state of war between Count Bonifacius, the military
governor of Africa, and the western emperor. The number of the
invaders was estimated at 80,000, of whom probably 15,000 or 20,000
were fighting men.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the reconciliation between Bonifacius and the imperial
government and their united opposition, Gaiseric was able to overrun
the open country although he failed to capture the chief cities. In
435 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> peace was concluded and the Vandals were allowed to settle
in Numidia, once more as <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi> of the empire. However, in 439
<pb n="356"/><anchor id="Pg356"/><hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Gaiseric broke the peace and treacherously seized Carthage.
This step was followed by the organization of a fleet which harried
the coasts of Sicily. In 442 the western emperor acknowledged the
independence of the Vandal kingdom. Peace continued until 455,
when the assassination of the emperor Valentinian III gave Gaiseric
the pretext for a descent upon Italy and the seizure of Rome which
was systematically plundered of its remaining treasures, although its
buildings and monuments were not wantonly destroyed. Among the
captives was Eudoxia, widow of the late emperor, and her daughters,
who were valuable hostages in the hands of Gaiseric.
</p>

<p>
The lack of coöperation between the eastern and western empires
against the Vandals enabled them to extend their power still further.
Their fleets controlled the whole of the Mediterranean and ravaged
both its western and its eastern coasts. A powerful expedition fitted
out by the eastern emperor Leo I in 468 for the invasion of Africa
ended in utter failure, and in 476 his successor Zeno was compelled
to come to terms and acknowledge the authority of the Vandals over
the territory under their control. At the death of Gaiseric in 477 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
the Vandal kingdom included all Roman Africa, the Balearic Islands,
Corsica, Sardinia, and the fortress of Lilybaeum in Sicily.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Burgundian invasion of Gaul.</hi> The invasion of Gaul by the
Vandals and Alans in 406 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> was followed by an inroad of the
Burgundians, Ripuarian Franks and Alemanni. The two latter peoples
established themselves on the left bank of the Rhine, while the
Burgundians penetrated further south. In 433 the Burgundians were
at war with the empire and were defeated by Aetius, the Roman master
of the soldiers in Gaul. Subsequently they were settled in the
Savoy. Thence, about 457, they began to expand until they occupied
the whole valley of the Rhone as far south as the Durance.
</p>

<p>
Yet on the whole they remained loyal <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi> of the empire.
They fought under Aetius against Attila in 451, and their kings bore
the Roman title of <hi rend="italic">magister militum</hi> until the reign of Gundobad
(473–516), who was given the rank of patrician by the emperor
Olybrius.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Salian Franks.</hi> The Salian Franks, as those who had once
dwelt on the shores of the North Sea were called in contrast to the
<pb n="357"/><anchor id="Pg357"/>Ripuarians, whose home was on the banks of the Rhine, crossed the
lower Rhine before the middle of the fourth century and occupied
Toxandria, the region between the Meuse and the Scheldt. They
were defeated by Julian who, however, left them in possession of this
district as Roman <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi>. The disturbances of the early fifth century
enabled the Salian Franks to assert their independence of Roman
suzerainty, and to extend their territory as far south as the Somme.
Still, they fought as Roman allies against the Huns in 451 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, and
their king Childeric, who began to rule shortly afterwards, remained
a faithful <hi rend="italic">foederatus</hi> of Rome until his death in 481 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
</p>

<p>
In 486 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Clovis, the successor of Childeric, overthrew the Gallo-Roman
state to the south of the Somme and extended his kingdom to
meet the Visigoths on the Loire. Thus the whole of Gaul passed
under the rule of Germanic peoples.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Saxons in Britain.</hi> After the decisive defeat of the Picts and
Scots by Theodosius, the father of Theodosius the Great, in 368 and
369 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, the Romans were able to maintain the defence of Britain
until the close of the fourth century. But in 402 Stilicho was obliged
to recall part of the garrison of the island for the protection of Italy,
and in 406 Constantine, who had laid claim to the imperial crown in
Britain, took with him the remaining Roman troops in his attempt to
obtain recognition on the continent. The ensuing struggles with the
barbarians in Gaul prevented the Romans from sending officials or
troops across the channel, and the Britons had to depend upon their
own resources for their defense.
</p>

<p>
The task proved beyond their strength and it is probable that by
the middle of the fifth century the Germanic tribes of Saxons, Angles
and Jutes were firmly established in the eastern part of Britain. Because
of the uncivilized character of these peoples, of the fact that
Roman culture was not very deeply rooted among the native population,
and of the desperate resistance offered by the latter to the invaders,
the subsequent struggle for the possession of the island resulted
in the obliteration of the Latin language and the disappearance
of that material civilization which had developed under four centuries
of Roman rule.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Honorius, 395–432 A. D.</hi> After the murder of Stilicho in 408
<pb n="358"/><anchor id="Pg358"/><hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, Honorius was faced with the problem of restoring his authority
in Gaul, where for a time he had been forced to acknowledge the rule
of a rival emperor Constantine who had donned the purple in Britain
in 406 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Constantius, a Roman noble who had succeeded Stilicho
as master of the soldiers, was despatched to Gaul in 411 and soon
overthrew the usurper. Two years later another rival, Jovinus, was
crushed with the help of the Visigoths.
</p>

<p>
Constantius, the leader of the anti-barbarian faction of the court,
was now the mainstay of the power of Honorius and used his influence
to further his own ambitions. After the surrender of the princess
Placidia by the Visigoths he induced the emperor to grant him her
hand in marriage (417 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). In 421 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Honorius appointed him
co-emperor, but he was not recognized as an Augustus at Constantinople
and died in the same year. His death was followed by a quarrel
between the emperor and his sister, as a result of which Placidia
and her son took refuge under the protection of the eastern emperor,
Theodosius II.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Valentinian III, 425–455 A. D.</hi> Honorius died in 423 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>,
leaving no children, and Castinus, the new master of the soldiers,
secured the nomination of John, a high officer of the court, as his successor.
However, Theodosius refused him recognition and his authority
was defied by Bonifacius, an influential officer who had established
himself in Africa. Valentinian, the five-year-old son of Placidia
and Constantius, was escorted to Italy by forces of the eastern
empire and John was deposed. His chief supporter Aetius, who had
brought an army of Huns to his aid, was induced to dismiss his troops
and accept a command in Gaul with the rank of count. Placidia,
who had returned to Italy with Valentinian, became regent with the
title of Augusta.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Aetius.</hi> During the reign of Valentinian III interest centers about
the career of Aetius, <q>last of the Romans.</q> In 429, after getting
rid of his enemy Felix, who had succeeded to the position of Castinus,
Aetius himself became master of the soldiers and the real ruler
of the empire. However, the Augusta Placidia endeavored to compass
his downfall by an appeal to Bonifacius, who after his revolt of
427 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> had fought in the imperial cause against the Vandals. In
432 Bonifacius returned to Italy and was appointed master of the
soldiers in place of Aetius. The latter appealed to arms, was defeated
near Ariminum, and forced to flee for refuge to his friends
<pb n="359"/><anchor id="Pg359"/>the Huns. But as Bonifacius died not long after his victory, Aetius,
with the backing of the Huns, was able to force the emperor to reappoint
him master of the soldiers in 433 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> From that time
until his death in 454 he directed the imperial policy in the West.
He received embassies from foreign peoples and the latter made treaties
with him and not with the emperor.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Attila’s invasion of Gaul, 451 A. D.</hi> The chief efforts of Aetius
were directed towards the preservation of central and southeastern
Gaul for the empire. In this he was successful, holding in check
the Franks on the north, the Burgundians on the east, and the Goths
in the southwest. But though Gaul was saved, Africa was lost to
the Vandals, Britain to the Saxons and the greater part of Spain to
the Suevi. The success of Aetius in Gaul was principally due to his
ability to draw into his service large numbers of Hunnish troops,
owing to the influence he had acquired with the leaders of that people
while a hostage among them. At this time the Huns occupied the
region of modern Hungary, Rumania, and South Russia. They comprised
a number of separate tribes, which in 444 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> were united
under the strong hand of King Attila, who also extended his sway over
neighboring Germanic and Scythian peoples.
</p>

<p>
At first Attila remained on friendly terms with Aetius but his ambitions
and his interference in the affairs of Gaul led to friction and
to his demand for the hand of Honoria, sister of Valentinian III,
with half of the western empire as her dowry. When the emperor
refused to comply Attila led a great army across the Rhine into Gaul
and laid siege to Orleans. Their common danger brought together
the Romans and the Germanic peoples of Gaul, and Aetius was able
to face the Huns with an army strengthened by the presence of the
kings of the Visigoths and the Franks. Repulsed at Orleans, Attila
withdrew to the Mauric plains where, in the vicinity of Troyes, a
memorable battle was fought between the Huns and the forces of
Aetius. Although the result was indecisive, Attila would not risk
another engagement and recrossed the Rhine. The next year he invaded
Italy, but the presence of famine and disease among his own
forces and the arrival of troops from the Eastern Empire induced
him to listen to the appeal of a Roman embassy, led by the Roman
bishop Leo, and to withdraw from the peninsula without occupying
Rome. Upon his death in 453 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> his empire fell to pieces and the
power of the Huns began to decline.
</p>

<pb n="360"/><anchor id="Pg360"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Maximus and Avitus, 455–6 A. D.</hi> The death of Attila was soon
followed by that of Aetius, who was murdered by Valentinian at the
instigation of his chamberlain Heraclius (454 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). This rash
act deprived him of the best support of his authority and in the next
year Valentinian himself fell a victim to the vengeance of followers
of Aetius. With him ended the dynasty of Theodosius in the West.
The new emperor, a senator named Petronius Maximus, compelled
Valentinian’s widow, Eudoxia, to marry him, but when the Vandal
Gaiseric appeared in Italy in answer to her call he offered no resistance
and perished in flight. Maximus was succeeded by Avitus, a
Gallic follower of Aetius, whom he had made master of the soldiers.
But after ruling little more than a year Avitus was deposed by his
own master of the soldiers, Ricimer (456 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Ricimer.</hi> Ricimer, a German of Suevic and Gothic ancestry, who
succeeded to the power of Aetius, was the virtual ruler of the western
empire from 456 until his death in 472. Backed by his mercenary
troops he made and unmade emperors at his pleasure, and never permitted
his nominees to be more than his puppets. Majorian, who was
appointed emperor in 457 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, was overthrown by Ricimer in 461,
and was followed by Severus. After the death of Severus in 465 no
emperor was appointed in the West for two years. The imperial
power was nominally concentrated in the hands of the eastern emperor,
Leo, while Ricimer was in actual control of the government in Italy.
In 467, Leo sent as emperor to Rome, Anthemius, a prominent dignitary
of the eastern court, whose daughter was married to Ricimer
in order to secure the coöperation of the latter in a joint attack of the
two empires upon the Vandal kingdom in Africa. However, in 472
Ricimer broke with Anthemius who had endeavored with the support
of the Roman Senate to free himself from the influence of the
powerful barbarian. Anthemius was besieged in Rome, and put to
death following the capture of the city. Thereupon Ricimer raised
to the purple Olybrius, a son-in-law of <anchor id="corr360"/><corr sic="Valetinian">Valentinian</corr> III. But both
the new emperor and his patron died in the course of the same year
(472 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The last years of the western empire.</hi> In 473 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Gundobad,
the nephew of Ricimer, caused Glycerius to be proclaimed emperor.
However, his appointment was not recognized by Leo, who nominated
Julius Nepos. The next year Nepos invaded Italy and overthrew his
rival, only to meet a like fate at the hands of Orestes, whom he had
<pb n="361"/><anchor id="Pg361"/>made master of the soldiers (475 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Orestes did not assume the
imperial title himself, but bestowed it upon his son Romulus, known
as Augustulus. But Orestes was unable to maintain his position for
long. The Germanic mercenaries in Italy—Herculi, Sciri, and
others—led by Odovacar, demanded for themselves lands in Italy
such as their kinsmen had been granted as <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi> in the provinces.
When their demands were refused they mutinied and slew Orestes.
Romulus was forced to abdicate, and Odovacar assumed the title of
king (476 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). The soldiers were settled on Italian soil and the
barbarians acquired full control of the western empire.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The kingship of Odovacar, 476–493 A. D.</hi> With the deposition
of Romulus Augustulus, the commander-in-chief of the barbarian
soldiery, long the virtual ruler in the western empire, was recognized
as legally exercising this power. The imperial authority was united
in the person of the eastern emperor who sanctioned the rule of
Odovacar by granting him the title of patrician, which had been held
already by Aetius, Ricimer and Orestes. The barbarian king was at
the same time the imperial regent in Italy.
</p>

<p>
But it was only in Italy that Odovacar obtained recognition. The
last remnants of Roman authority vanished in Gaul and Spain, while
Raetia and Noricum were abandoned to the Alamanni, Thuringi and
Rugii.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Ostrogothic conquest of Italy, 488–493 A. D.</hi> In 488 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
the position of Odovacar in Italy was challenged by Theodoric, king
of the Ostrogoths. This people after having long been subject to
the Huns, recovered their freedom at the death of Attila, and settled
in Pannonia as <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi> of the eastern empire. Theodoric, who became
sole ruler of the Ostrogoths in 481 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, had proved himself a
troublesome ally of the emperor Zeno who mistrusted his ambitions.
Accordingly when Theodoric demanded an imperial commission to
attack Odovacar in Italy, Zeno readily granted him the desired authority
in order to remove him to a greater distance from Constantinople.
In 488 Theodoric set out with his followers to invade Italy.
Odovacar was defeated in two battles and, in 490 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, blockaded
in Ravenna. After a long siege he agreed to surrender upon condition
that he and Theodoric should rule jointly over Italy. Shortly
afterwards he and most of his followers were treacherously assassinated
by the Ostrogoths (493 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Theodoric now ruled Italy as
king of the Ostrogoths and an official of the Roman empire, probably
<pb n="362"/><anchor id="Pg362"/>retaining the title of master of the soldiers which he had held in the
East.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Arcadius, 395–408 A. D.</hi> The year of the death of Theodosius
the Great saw the Asiatic provinces of the empire overrun by the
Huns who ravaged Syria and Asia Minor, while the Visigoths under
Alaric devastated the Balkan peninsula. The absence of the eastern
troops in Italy prevented the government from offering any effective
opposition to either foe. And when Stilicho came to the rescue from
Italy and was holding the Visigoths in check, his rival the praetorian
prefect Rufinus, who directed the policy of the young Arcadius, induced
the emperor to order Stilicho to withdraw and sent the troops
of the East to Constantinople. This order resulted in the death of
Rufinus, who was killed by the returning soldiery at the orders of
their commander, the Goth Gaïnas.
</p>

<p>
The influential position of Rufinus at the court fell to the grand-chamberlain
Eutropius, who had been an enemy of the late prefect.
He had induced Arcadius to marry Eudoxia, daughter of a Frankish
chief, instead of the daughter of Rufinus, as the latter had desired.
The fall of Eutropius was brought about by Gaïnas, now a master
of the soldiers, who sought to play the rôle of Stilicho in the East.
He was supported by the empress Eudoxia, who chafed under the
domination of the chamberlain. In 399 on the occasion of a revolt
of the Gothic troops in Phrygia, Gaïnas held aloof and the failure
of the nominee of Eutropius to crush the movement gave him the
opportunity to bring about the latter’s dismissal and eventually his
death.
</p>

<p>
But Gaïnas did not long retain his power. He quarrelled with
the empress, and the Arianism of himself and his followers roused
the animosity of the population of the capital. A massacre of the
Goths in Constantinople followed and with the aid of a loyal Goth
Fravitta, Gaïnas was driven north of the Danube where he was slain
by the Huns (400 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). The influence of Eudoxia was now paramount.
However, she found a critic in the eloquent bishop of Constantinople,
John Chrysostom, who inveighed against the extravagance
and dissipation of the society of the court, and directed his censures
towards the empress in particular. Ultimately, Eudoxia was able to
<pb n="363"/><anchor id="Pg363"/>have him deposed from his see in 404 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, a few months before his
death. Four years later Arcadius himself died, leaving the empire
to his eight-year-old son Theodosius II.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Theodosius II, 408–450 A. D.</hi> At the opening of the reign of
Theodosius II the government was in the hands of the praetorian prefect
Anthemius, who had shown himself an able administrator during
the last years of Arcadius. However, in 414, the emperor’s elder
sister, Pulcheria, was made regent with the title of Augusta. She
was a strong personality and for many years completely dominated
the emperor who was lacking in independence of character and energy.
In 421 Pulcheria selected as a wife for Theodosius, Athenais, the
daughter of an Athenian sophist, who took the name of Eudocia
upon accepting Christianity. After a lapse of some years differences
arose between the empress and her sister-in-law which led to the latter’s
withdrawal from the court (after 431 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). But, about 440,
Eudocia lost her influence over the emperor; she was compelled to
retire from Constantinople and reside in Jerusalem, where she lived
until her death in 460. The reins of power then passed to the grand
chamberlain Chrysapius, whose corrupt administration rivalled that
of his predecessor Eutropius.
</p>

<p>
During the reign of Theodosius II the peace of the eastern empire
was broken by a war with Persia and by inroads of the Huns. The
Persian war which began in 421 as a result of persecutions of the
Christians in Persia was brought to a victorious conclusion in the
next year. A second war, the result of a Persian invasion in 441,
ended with a Persian defeat in 442. But with the Huns the Romans
were not so fortunate. In 434, king Rua, the ruler of the Huns in
the plains of Hungary, had extorted from the empire the payment
of an annual tribute to secure immunity from invasion. At the accession
of Attila and his brother in 433, this tribute was raised to
700 pounds of gold and the Romans were forbidden to give shelter
to fugitives from the power of the Huns. But the payment of tribute
failed to win a permanent respite, for Attila was bent on draining the
wealth of the empire and reducing it to a condition of helplessness.
In 441–43 the Huns swarmed over the Balkan provinces and defeated
the imperial armies. An indemnity of 6000 pounds of gold was exacted
and the annual payment increased to 2100 pounds. Another
disastrous raid occurred in 447. The empire could offer no resistance,
and so Chrysapius plotted the assassination of Attila, but the
<pb n="364"/><anchor id="Pg364"/>plot was detected. Attila claimed to regard himself as the overlord
of Theodosius.
</p>

<p>
In 438 there was published the Theodosian code, a collection of
imperial edicts which constituted the administrative law of the empire,
and which was accepted in the West as well as in the East.
Theodosius died in 450, without having made any arrangements for
a successor.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Marcian, 450–57 A. D.</hi> The officials left the choice of a new
emperor to the Augusta Pulcheria. She selected Marcian, a tried
officer, to whom she gave her hand in formal marriage. Marcian
proved himself an able and conscientious ruler. He refused to continue
the indemnity to Attila, and was able to adhere to this policy
owing to the latter’s invasion of the West and subsequent death. It
was he who permitted the Ostrogoths to settle as <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi> in Pannonia
(454 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Leo I, 457–474 A. D.</hi> At the death of Marcian in 457 the imperial
authority was conferred upon Leo, an officer of Dacian origin.
His appointment was due to the Alan Aspar, one of the masters of
the soldiers, whose power in the East rivalled that of Ricimer in the
West. But Leo did not intend to be the puppet of the powerful general,
whose loyalty he eventually came to suspect. Accordingly as a
counterpoise to the Gothic mercenaries and <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi>, the mainstay of
Aspar’s power, he drew into his service the Isaurians, the warlike
mountaineers of southern Anatolia, who had defied the empire under
Arcadius and Theodosius. The emperor’s eldest daughter was given
in marriage to Zeno, an Isaurian, who was made master of the soldiers
in the Orient. However, in 470 Aspar was still strong enough
to force Leo to bestow the hand of his second daughter upon his son
Leontius and to appoint the latter Caesar. But in the following year
when Zeno returned to Constantinople the Alan and his eldest sons
were treacherously assassinated in the palace.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Leo II, 473–4 A. D.</hi> In 473 Leo took as his colleague and destined
successor his grandson, also called Leo, the son of Zeno. The
death of the elder Leo occurred early in 474, and the younger soon
crowned his father Zeno as co-emperor. When Leo II died before
the close of the same year, Zeno became sole ruler.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Zeno, 474–491 A. D.</hi> The reign of Zeno was an almost uninterrupted
struggle against usurpers and revolting Gothic <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi>. In
<pb n="365"/><anchor id="Pg365"/>474 occurred an outbreak of the latter led by their king Theodoric the
son of Triarius, called Strabo or <q>the Squinter,</q> who ruled over the
Goths settled in Thrace as a master of the soldiers of the empire.
Before this revolt was over, the unpopularity of the Isaurians induced
Basiliscus, the brother-in-law of Leo I, to plot to seize the throne for
himself. He was supported by his sister, the ex-empress Verina, and
Illus, the chief Isaurian officer in Zeno’s service. The conspirators
seized Constantinople and proclaimed Basiliscus emperor (475 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
But his heretical religious views aroused strong opposition, and he
was deserted by both Verina and Illus. Zeno re-entered the capital
and Basiliscus was executed.
</p>

<p>
During the revolt Zeno had been supported by Theoderic the Amal,
a Gothic prince who was a rival of Theoderic son of Triarius. The
emperor therefore tried to crush the latter with the help of the former,
but the two Theoderics came to an agreement and acted in concert
against Zeno (478 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). In 479 peace was made with Strabo, but
hostilities continued with the Amal. At this time another insurrection
broke out in Constantinople, under the leadership of Marcian,
a son-in-law of Leo I, as a protest against the predominance of the
Isaurians, in particular Illus. However, this revolt was easily put
down.
</p>

<p>
Theoderic son of Triarius was killed in 481, and in 483 Zeno
made peace with Theoderic the Amal, creating him patrician and
master of the soldiers, and granting him lands in Dacia and lower
Moesia. These concessions were made in consequence of the antagonism
which had developed between the emperor and his all-powerful
minister Illus. This friction culminated in 484 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> when Illus,
who was master of the soldiers in the Orient, induced the dowager
empress Verina to crown a general, named Leontius, as emperor.
But outside of Isauria the movement found little support and after
a long siege in an Isaurian fortress the leaders of the revolt were
taken and put to death (488 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). In the meantime Theoderic the
Amal had asked and received an imperial warrant for the conquest
of Italy, and with the departure of the Goths the eastern empire
was delivered from the danger of Germanic domination. Zeno died
in April, 491 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Anastasius, 491–518 A. D.</hi> The choice of a successor was left
to the empress Ariadne, who selected as emperor and her husband an
<pb n="366"/><anchor id="Pg366"/>experienced officer of the court, Anastasius. The first act of Anastasius
was to remove the Isaurian officials and troops from Constantinople.
This led to an Isaurian rebellion in southern Asia
Minor which was not stamped out until 498. In the struggle the
power of the Isaurians was broken, their strongholds were captured,
part of their population transported to Thrace, and they ceased to be
a menace to the peace of the empire.
</p>

<p>
In the place of the Goths new enemies appeared on the Danubian
border in the Slavic Getae and the Bulgars who overran the depopulated
provinces of the northern Balkan peninsula. So extended were
their ravages and so utterly did the imperial troops fail to hold them
in check that Anastasius was obliged to build a wall across the peninsula,
upon which the city of Constantinople stands, for the protection
of the capital itself. Anastasius had also to cope with a serious
Persian war which began with an invasion of Roman Armenia and
Mesopotamia by King Kawad in 502 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> After four years of border
warfare, in which the Persians gained initial success but the fortune
of the Roman arms was restored by the master of the offices
Celer, peace was reëstablished on the basis of the <hi rend="italic">status quo ante</hi><anchor id="corr366"/><corr sic=",">.</corr>
</p>

<p>
The civil administration of Anastasius is noteworthy for the abolition
of the tax called the <hi rend="italic">chrysargyrum</hi> (498 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), and his relief
of the <hi rend="italic">curiales</hi> from the responsibility for the collection of the municipal
taxes. A testimony of the increasing influences of Christian
morality was the abolition of certain pagan festivals and of combats
between gladiators and wild beasts in the circus.
</p>

<p>
But in spite of the justness and efficiency of his administration
the reign of Anastasius was marked by several popular upheavals in
Constantinople, and in other cities of the empire as well. The cause
lay in his sympathy for the monophysite doctrine which was vigorously
opposed by the orthodox Christians. In 512 the appointment
of a monophysite bishop at Constantinople provoked a serious rebellion
which almost cost Anastasius his throne.
</p>

<p>
Although the emperor was able to quiet the city rabble by a display
of cool courage the prevailing religious discord encouraged Vitalian,
the commander of the Bulgarian <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi> in the Thracian army, to
raise the standard of revolt (514 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). He defeated all forces sent
against him and endangered the safety of the capital. However, he
was induced to withdraw by a ransom of 5000 pounds of gold and
<pb n="367"/><anchor id="Pg367"/>the office of master of the soldiers in Thrace. But the truce was only
temporary, and in 515 he again advanced on Constantinople. This
time his forces met with a crushing defeat on land and sea, and the
rebellion came to an end. Three years later Anastasius died.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">I. The Germanic Kingdoms in the West to 533 a. d.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Germans and the Romans.</hi> The passing of Italy and the
western provinces under the sway of Germanic kings was accomplished,
as we have seen, by the settlement of large numbers of barbarians
in the conquered territories. This necessitated a division of
the soil and a definition of the status of the Romans with respect to
the invaders, who were everywhere less numerous than the native
population. These questions were settled in different ways in the
several kingdoms.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Under the Visigoths.</hi> In the Visigothic kingdom in Gaul the
Goths and the Romans lived side by side as separate peoples, each
enjoying its own laws, and the Romans were not regarded as subjects
having no rights against their conquerors. However, intermarriage
between the two races was forbidden. The law which applied
to the Romans was published by King Alaric in 506 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, and
is known as the <hi rend="italic">Lex Romana Visigothorum</hi>, or the Breviary of
Alaric; his predecessor Euric had caused the compilation of a code
of the Gothic customary law in imitation of the imperial Theodosian
code.
</p>

<p>
The settlement of the Goths on the land took the form of <hi rend="italic">hospitium</hi>
or quartering. By this arrangement the Roman landholders gave up
to the Goths two thirds of their property, both the land itself and the
cattle, <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> and slaves which were on it. The shares which the
Goths received were not subject to taxation.
</p>

<p>
For the purposes of administration the Roman provincial and municipal
divisions were retained (<hi rend="italic">provinciae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">civitates</hi>), the former
being placed under <hi rend="italic">duces</hi> and the latter under <hi rend="italic">comites civitatum</hi>.
The Goths settled within these districts formed their national associations
of tens, hundreds, and thousands, under native Gothic officers.
But the adoption of a more settled form of life deeply affected
the Gothic tribal institutions. The Gothic national assembly could
no longer be easily called together and came to exist in the form of
<pb n="370"/><anchor id="Pg370"/>the army alone. In the division of the land the more influential
warriors and friends of the king received the larger shares and this
helped the rise of a landed nobility. The government was concentrated
at the capital, Toulouse, where central ministries were established
modelled on those of the Roman court. This led to a considerable
strengthening of the royal power. The language of government
remained Gothic for the Goths and Latin for the Romans,
but the leading Goths appear to have been familiar with both tongues.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Under the Vandals.</hi> In the Vandal kingdom of Africa the position
of the Romans was much less favorable. They were treated as
conquered subjects, and, as under the Goths, intermarriage between
them and the conquering race was prohibited. In the province of
Zeugitana (old Africa), where the Vandal settlement occurred, the
Roman landowners were completely dispossessed and their estates
turned over to new proprietors. The <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> and other tenants, however,
remained on the soil, and the Vandal landlords entrusted the
management of their properties to Roman stewards. Elsewhere the
Romans were undisturbed in their possessions.
</p>

<p>
The Roman administrative territorial divisions were retained, but
the regions settled by the Vandals stood outside of these and had a
separate organization. Here the Vandals preserved their tribal divisions
of hundreds and thousands. The administration of justice
for the Vandals was in the hands of their own officials and according
to their customary laws; for the Romans it rested with their previous
authorities in accordance with Roman law but under the supervision
of the Vandal king.
</p>

<p>
The Vandal kingdom was a strongly centralized monarchy. This
led to the development of a nobility based on employment in the imperial
service. The African climate and the sudden acquirement of
wealth which enabled them to enjoy all the luxurious extravagance of
Roman life in the upper classes of society soon produced an enervating
effect upon the northern conquerors. On the other hand, although
they were completely lacking in political rights, the Roman
agricultural population of Africa felt the rule of the Vandals to be
less oppressive than that of the Roman bureaucracy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Under the Ostrogoths.</hi> In Italy, Odovacar had maintained the
Roman administrative system in its entirety and Theoderic continued
his policy. He made no attempt to found a new state but regarded
himself as one of the rulers of the Roman empire. In 497 he asked
<pb n="371"/><anchor id="Pg371"/>and received from Anastasius the symbols of imperial power which
Odovacar had sent to Constantinople upon the deposition of Romulus
Augustulus in 476. From this time the Gothic king may be regarded
as a colleague of the eastern emperor. Not merely did he
retain the Roman administrative organization but all his civil officials
were Romans. He published an edict which constituted a code of
law applicable to Goths and Romans alike. So thoroughly Roman
was Theoderic’s administration that even the army was open to
Romans, who are found among his prominent generals.
</p>

<p>
The Ostrogoths received assignments of land in Italy but it seems
probable that there was no confiscation of private property, one third
of the state lands being allotted for this purpose. Ravenna was the
royal residence and center of government, but the Roman Senate exercised
a great deal of influence and until the later years of his reign
cordially supported the authority of Theoderic.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Burgundians and the Franks.</hi> The Burgundians in the
Rhone valley effected their settlement like the Visigoths according to
the system of <hi rend="italic">hospitium</hi>. In general their relations with the Roman
population were peaceful, intermarriage between the two peoples was
sanctioned, and the Burgundian kings showed themselves appreciative
of Roman culture. Gundobad, who reigned from 473 to 516, issued
both a code of Burgundian laws and the Burgundian Roman Law
(<hi rend="italic">Lex Romana Burgundionum</hi>) which applied to his Roman subjects
and also to the Burgundians in their disputes with Romans. The
Franks in the course of their advance to the Seine had annihilated
the Roman population of northern Gaul. However, in the region between
the Seine and the Loire they left the Romans in undisturbed
possession of their property, the Frankish kings making no distinction
between their Frank and Roman subjects.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The religious question.</hi> In addition to racial differences, there
was also a religious line of demarcation between the Goths, Vandals
and Burgundians on the one hand, and the Roman population on the
other. The Goths and neighboring Germanic peoples had been converted
to Christianity in the latter half of the fourth century, largely
through the missionary activities of Ulfila, who translated the Bible
into Gothic. However, they had been won to the Arian and not the
Nicaean creed, and consequently were regarded as heretics by the
orthodox Romans, who never became reconciled to rulers of another
confession than themselves. This hostility led frequently to
govern<pb n="372"/><anchor id="Pg372"/>ment intervention and persecution. But in this respect the policy of
the several Germanic kingdoms varied under different rulers.
</p>

<p>
In general the Visigoths pursued a policy of toleration, leaving the
orthodox clergy undisturbed except when the latter were guilty of disloyalty
in giving support to outside enemies. At the time of their
settlement in Zeugitana the Vandals confiscated the property of the
orthodox church in that province and turned it over to their own
Arian clergy. Elsewhere in Africa the Catholics remained unmolested
during the reign of Gaiseric but were persecuted by his successors.
In the Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy Theoderic, although an
Arian, gave complete freedom to the orthodox church throughout the
greater part of his rule. However, his policy changed when the eastern
emperor, Justin, began to persecute the Arians within his dominions
in 523 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> The ban upon Arianism found support among
the Romans in Italy, particularly among the orthodox clergy and the
senators. This caused Theoderic to suspect that the emperor’s action
had been stimulated by a faction in the Roman Senate, and led to the
execution of Boethius and other notables on the charge of treason.
Realizing the effect that the imperial proscription of Arianism would
produce upon the relations of his Roman and Gothic subjects, Theoderic
sent a delegation, headed by the bishop of Rome, to Constantinople
to secure the annulment of the anti-Arian decree. When he
failed to attain this, he resolved upon a general persecution of the
Catholics which was forestalled, however, by his death in 526 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Burgundians were also Arians, and this prevented their winning
the loyal support of the orthodox clergy, who, however, recognized
the authority of the Burgundian kings. Although Sigismund,
the son of Gundobad, who came to the throne in 516, was converted
to orthodoxy, it was too late to heal this religious breach before the
fall of the Burgundian power.
</p>

<p>
Unlike their neighbors, the Visigoths and Burgundians, the Franks
were pagans when they established themselves upon Roman territory
and remained so until toward the close of the fifth century. In 496
the Frankish king Clovis was converted to Christianity, and to the
orthodox, not the Arian, belief, a fact of supreme importance in his
relations with the other Germanic peoples in Gaul.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The expansion of the Franks.</hi> The foreign policy of Theoderic
was directed towards strengthening his position in Italy by establishing
friendly relations with the western Germanic kingdoms and
main<pb n="373"/><anchor id="Pg373"/>taining peace and a balance of power among them. To this end he
contracted a series of family alliances with the rulers of these states.
In 492 he himself wedded a sister of Clovis the Frank, and gave his
own sister in marriage to the Vandal king Thrasamund. One of his
daughters became the wife of Sigismund, king of the Burgundians,
and another was married to Alaric II, who succeeded Euric as king of
the Visigoths.
</p>

<p>
However, Theoderic’s scheme was rudely disturbed by the ambitions
of Clovis. In 496 the latter conquered the Alamanni. He next
forced the Burgundians to acknowledge his overlordship, and with
these as his allies in 507 he attacked the Visigothic kingdom. The
conquests of Euric in Gaul and Spain had overtaxed the strength of
the Visigothic people and weakened their hold upon the territory they
occupied. Furthermore, their Roman subjects gave active aid to the
orthodox Clovis. In a battle near Poitiers the Visigoths were defeated
and their king, Alaric II, slain. Theoderic had been hindered
from intervening previously by the outbreak of hostilities between
himself and the emperor Anastasius, who gave his sanction to the
action of Clovis and sent him the insignia of the consulship. Now,
however, the Ostrogothic king came to the aid of the Visigoths. He
repulsed the Franks and Burgundians before Arles (508 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). and
recovered Narbonese Gaul. However, the greater part of Aquitania
remained in the hands of the Franks. Theoderic established his
grandson Amalaric as king of the Visigoths and exercised a regency
in his name (510 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Clovis died in 511 and the expansion of
the Franks ceased for a time. However, the death of Theoderic in
526 was the signal for fresh disturbances. The Visigothic king
Amalaric at once asserted his independence in southern Gaul and in
Spain. But not long afterwards, in 531, he fell in battle against the
Franks, who seized the remaining Visigothic possessions in Gaul except
Septimania—the coast district between the Pyrenees and the
Rhone. Three years later they overthrew the kingdom of the Burgundians
and so brought under their sway the whole of Gaul outside
of Septimania and Provence.
</p>

<p>
In 533 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> the situation in the west was as follows. Gaul was
mainly in the hands of the Franks, Spain was under the Visigoths,
the Vandals were still established in Africa, and the Ostrogoths in
Italy. Both of the latter kingdoms, however, were showing signs of
internal weakness. In addition to the hostility between the Germanic
<pb n="374"/><anchor id="Pg374"/>conquerors and the subject Roman population, factional strife had
broken out over the succession to the throne. Evidence of the declining
power of the Vandals in particular was the success of the
Moorish tribes in winning their independence. By 525 both Mauretania
and Numidia had been abandoned to them, and the tribes of
Tripolis had shaken off the Vandal yoke. In 530 the Moors of
southern Byzacene inflicted a severe defeat on the Vandals, which led
to the deposition of the ruling king. The weakness of these states
seemed to offer a favorable opportunity for the reëstablishment of
the imperial authority in the West.

553–554 a. d.</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Justin I, 518–527 A. D.</hi> Anastasius died in 518 and was succeeded
by Justin, an Illyrian of humble origin who had risen to the
important post of commander of the imperial body guard (<hi rend="italic">comes
excubitorum</hi>). Unlike his predecessor Justin was an adherent of the
orthodox faith, and at the opening of his reign an exceedingly influential
position was held by the general Vitalian, who had been the
champion of orthodoxy against Anastasius. He became master of
the soldiers at Constantinople and in 520 was honored with the consulship.
But his power and unscrupulous ambitions constituted a
real menace to the emperor and induced the latter to procure his
murder. Justin ruled for nine years. He was an experienced soldier,
but illiterate, and personally unequal to the task of imperial
government. The guiding spirit of his administration was his
nephew Justinian, who was largely responsible for Vitalian’s removal.
In fact the reign of Justin served as a brief introduction to
the long rule of Justinian himself, whom his uncle crowned as his
colleague in 527 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, and who became sole emperor at the latter’s
death in the same year.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Justinian’s imperial policy.</hi> Justinian was by birth a Latin
peasant from near Scupi (modern Uskub) in Upper Moesia, but
through his uncle he had been able to enjoy all the educational advantages
offered by the schools of Constantinople. In public life he
showed himself a laborious and careful administrator, of an extremely
autocratic, and yet at the same time somewhat vacillating, character.
He was a devout Christian, zealous for the propagation of the
ortho<pb n="375"/><anchor id="Pg375"/>dox faith, with a strong liking for, and considerable learning in,
questions of dogmatic theology. He regarded religious and secular
affairs as equally subject to the imperial will, and in each sphere he
exercised absolute authority. In him the ideal of autocracy found
its most perfect embodiment.
</p>

<p>
The goal of Justinian’s imperial policy was the recovery of the
lands of the western empire from their Germanic rulers and the reëstablishment
of imperial unity in the person of the eastern emperor.
The attainment of unity of belief throughout the Christian world he
regarded as no less important than that of political unity: one empire,
one church, was his motto.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Reconciliation with the western Church: 519 A. D.</hi> The way
was paved for the reconquest of the Roman West by a reconciliation
with the Roman bishop Hormisdas, as a result of which orthodoxy
was once more formally received at Constantinople and a persecution
of the monophysites and other heretics inaugurated in the eastern
empire (519 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Although this union with Rome was brought
about while the influence of Vitalian was predominant, it had the
cordial support of Justinian, who recognized that the good will of the
clergy and the Roman population of the western provinces would in
this way be won for the eastern emperor. Such proved to be the
case, and the subsequent wars for the recovery of the West assumed
the aspect of crusades for the deliverance of the followers of the
orthodox church from Arian domination.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Outbreak of the Vandal war, 533 A. D.</hi> The deposition of
Hilderic, who had been on friendly terms with the eastern empire,
and the accession of Gelimer who reverted to an anti-Roman policy,
afforded Justinian a pretext for intervention in the Vandal kingdom.
In conformity with his policy of treating the Germanic kings as vassal
princes of the empire, he demanded the reinstatement of Hilderic,
and when this was refused, he prepared to invade Africa. An expeditionary
force of ten thousand foot and five thousand horse, accompanied
by a powerful fleet, was placed under the command of the
able general Belisarius and despatched from Constantinople in 533
<hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> An alliance concluded with the Ostrogoths forestalled the possibility
of their coming to the aid of the Vandals.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The military condition of the empire.</hi> The imperial armies
of the sixth century were entirely composed of mercenary troops.
While the voluntary enlistment of barbarians had been a regular
<pb n="376"/><anchor id="Pg376"/>method of recruitment from the time of Diocletian, such troops were
at first enrolled directly in the imperial service. But by the opening
of the sixth century it had become customary for private individuals,
as a rule officers of repute, to enlist troops in their personal service.
Such troops were known as <hi rend="italic">bucellarii</hi>, from the word <hi rend="italic">bucella</hi>, signifying
soldiers’ bread. These <hi rend="italic">bucellarii</hi> were usually taken into the
service of the state along with their leaders, and were then maintained
at the public expense. It was with mercenaries of this type that the
ranks of Justinian’s armies were largely filled. For the most part
they were veteran troops and good fighters, but with all the weaknesses
of their class. They were greedy of plunder, impatient of
discipline, and both officers and men displayed a conspicuous lack
of loyalty. The most effective troops were the <hi rend="italic">cataphracti</hi>, mailed
horsemen armed with bow, lance and sword. Beside them the infantry
played only a subordinate rôle. The fact that the government was
obliged to rely upon <hi rend="italic">condottieri</hi> for its own maintenance reveals the
internal decay of the whole imperial system, and the smallness of the
forces which it could put into the field shows the weakness of its
resources compared with the aims of Justinian and explains the
protracted character of the wars of the period. In fact, the emperor
was on the point of abandoning the invasion of Africa for financial
reasons, when the prophecy of an eastern bishop induced him to
persevere.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The reconquest of Africa, 533–4 A. D.</hi> The landing of Belisarius
in Africa (September, 533) completely surprised the Vandals.
Gailimer was defeated in battle and Belisarius occupied Carthage.
A second defeat before the close of the year sealed the fate of the
Vandal kingdom. Early in 534 Gailimer surrendered and all resistance
came to an end. The Vandal insular possessions—Sardinia,
Corsica and the Balearic Islands—fell to the Romans without
further opposition.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Revolts of the Moors.</hi> However, the Moors, who had managed
to assert their independence against the Vandals, were not disposed
to pass under the Roman yoke without a struggle. A revolt which
broke out in 535 was not finally crushed until 539; and another,
which was complicated by a mutiny of the imperial troops, raged
between 546 and 548. In the end, the Roman authority was reëstablished
over all the African provinces except Mauretania Caesariensis
and <anchor id="corr376"/><corr sic="Tignitana">Tingitana</corr>. The previous system of civil administration was
<pb n="377"/><anchor id="Pg377"/>revived and elaborate measures taken to secure the defence of the
frontiers. However, the ravages of the Moors and the war of restoration
had played sad havoc with economic conditions in Africa, and
in spite of government assistance, its former prosperity was never
revived. Still, Africa had been recovered for the empire and was
destined to remain a part of it until the Saracen invasion nearly a
century and a half later.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The recovery of Italy, first phase, 535–540 A. D.</hi> The overthrow
of the Vandal kingdom had scarcely been accomplished when
events in Italy gave Justinian the desired pretext for the invasion
of the peninsula. Upon the death of King Athalaric, Theoderic’s
grandson and successor, in 534, his mother, the regent Amalasuntha,
had married Theodahad, whom she made her consort. Shortly afterwards,
however, he caused her to be imprisoned and, when she appealed
to Justinian for aid, put her to death. As the avenger of his
former ally, Justinian made war upon the Gothic king. The possession
of Africa gave the Romans an excellent base of operations
against Italy. In 535 Belisarius invaded Sicily with 7500 men
and speedily reduced the whole island, while another Roman army
marched on Dalmatia. From Sicily Belisarius crossed into South
Italy, where he found little resistance. The inactivity of Theodahad
produced a revolt among his own people. He was deposed, and
Witiges became king in his place. The new king was able to purchase
the neutrality of the Franks, who were in alliance with Justinian,
by ceding to them the Ostrogothic possessions in South Gaul. However,
Belisarius continued his advance and occupied Rome (December,
536 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). There he was besieged for a year (March, 537 to
March, 538) by the Goths, who were in the end forced to abandon
the blockade and fall back upon North Italy. At the same time,
the eunuch Narses arrived in Italy at the head of a new Roman
army. But since his presence was largely due to Justinian’s mistrust
of Belisarius, he failed to coöperate with the latter and accomplished
nothing before his recall in 539. The last episode of the
campaign was the siege of Ravenna (539–540 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), which was
defended by the Gothic king. With its fall and his capture in 540,
the resistance of the Goths came to an end. Italy was declared a
Roman province, the civil administration was reëstablished, and
Belisarius was recalled to assume the command against Persia.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Second phase, 541–554 A. D.</hi> But the withdrawal of Belisarius
<pb n="378"/><anchor id="Pg378"/>and his best troops led to a revolt of the Goths under the leadership
of the brave and energetic Totila (or Baduila) in 541. Within the
next three years he drove the Roman garrisons from the greater part
of Italy, including Rome. Belisarius was despatched against him,
but was given inadequate support and accomplished nothing except
the recovery of Rome, which he held until he was recalled at his own
request in 548. The drain of a fresh Persian war upon the resources
of the empire forced Justinian to the temporary abandonment of
Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and Italy, apart from Ravenna and a few
other fortresses. At last in 552 he was able to resume the struggle
and entrusted the conduct of the war to Narses, whose ability as a
commander was superior to that of Belisarius himself. The army
of Narses numbered over 30,000, and consisted chiefly of barbarian
auxiliaries, in particular Lombards, who had been settled as <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi>
in Noricum since 547. Narses marched upon Italy by way of
Illyricum and reached the Roman base at Ravenna. Thence he
advanced towards Rome and met and defeated the Goths in a decisive
engagement in Umbria (552 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). Totila fell in the battle. A
second victory in Campania in the following spring forced the surviving
Goths to come to terms. They were allowed to leave Italy
and seek a new home beyond the Roman borders. A fresh enemy
then appeared in the Franks, who had been nominal allies of the
Goths but had rendered them little assistance. A horde of Alamanni
and Franks swept down upon Italy and penetrated deep into the
peninsula. But Narses annihilated one of their divisions at Capua
(554 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), and the remainder were decimated by disease and forced
to withdraw. The Roman sway was firmly established over Italy as
far as the Alps; but Raetia, Noricum and the Danubian provinces
remained lost to the empire.
</p>

<p>
The long and bitter wars of restoration had wrought frightful
damage to the material welfare of Italy, and the heavy financial burdens
imposed by the Roman administrative system aroused bitter
protests. The measures of relief attempted proved insufficient, the
middle class disappeared, the richer landed proprietors left the peninsula,
and, as in Africa, the former prosperity was never recalled.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The attempted recovery of Spain, 554 A. D.</hi> Following the
conclusion of hostilities in Italy, Justinian seized the opportunity
which presented itself for intervention in Spain. He sent an army
to the support of the rebel Agila against Athanagild, the king of the
<pb n="379"/><anchor id="Pg379"/>Visigoths (554 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). The Roman forces occupied Corduba, Carthagena
and other coast towns, but on the death of Athanagild, Agila
succeeded to his throne and headed the Visigothic opposition to the
Romans, who were unable to advance further. However, they retained
what they had already conquered.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Extent of the Roman conquests.</hi> Justinian’s policy had resulted
in the overthrow of the Vandal and Ostrogothic kingdoms, and in
the recovery for the empire of Africa, Italy, the Mediterranean islands,
and a strip of the Spanish coast. More, the empire was too weak to
accomplish.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. Justinian’s Frontier Problems and Internal Administration</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Barbarian invasions of the Balkan peninsula.</hi> The strain
which the policy of expansion in the West imposed upon the strength
of the empire is clearly seen in the failure to defend the Danubian
frontier and the ineffective conduct of the Persian wars. Time after
time hordes of Bulgars and Slavs poured into the Balkans. Especially
destructive were the inroads of 540 and 559. In the former
the invaders penetrated as far as the Isthmus of Corinth; in the
latter they threatened the capital itself, but were driven off by the
aged Belisarius.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Persian wars.</hi> In 527, the Persian king Kawad declared
war upon the empire. The struggle was indecisive, and, at the death
of Kawad in 532, Justinian, who wished to be free at any price to
pursue his western policy, was able to conclude peace with his successor,
Chosroes I, upon condition of paying an annual indemnity.
But the successes of Justinian in the West aroused the jealousy and
ambitions of Chosroes in 539. The Persians overran Syria and
captured Antioch, carrying off its population into captivity (540).
However, they failed to take Edessa (544). In Mesopotamia an
armistice was concluded in 545, although war continued between
the Arab dependents of both states, and in the district of Lazica
(ancient Colchis), a Roman protectorate which transferred its allegiance
to Persia. Finally, a fifty years’ peace was concluded in 562
<hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> The Roman suzerainty over Lazica was acknowledged by the
Persians, but the Romans obligated themselves to pay the Persians a
heavy annual subsidy, in return for which the Persians undertook the
<pb n="381"/><anchor id="Pg381"/>defence of the Caucasus. In this way the Persians became technically
Roman <hi rend="italic">foederati</hi>; however, as in the case of the Visigoths in the
fourth century, this was equivalent to a confession that the Romans
were unable to subdue their enemy, who looked upon the subsidy
as tribute.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The empress Theodora.</hi> In 523 Justinian married Theodora, a
former professional pantomime actress from the purlieus of the Hippodrome,
after he had induced his uncle to cancel the law which forbade
the marriage of senators and actresses. And when Justinian
became emperor in 527, Theodora was crowned with him as Augusta.
From that time until her death in 553 she was in a very real sense
joint ruler with her husband. Whatever the character of her previous
career, her private life as empress was beyond reproach. She was
fond of power, jealous of the influence of others with the emperor,
and unforgiving towards those who thwarted her purposes; both
Belisarius and John of Cappadocia, the powerful praetorian prefect,
were driven from the emperor’s service by her enmity. On the other
hand, she was a woman of dauntless courage, and possessed of remarkable
foresight in political affairs.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The <q>Nika</q> riot, 532 A. D.</hi> The courage of the empress was
conspicuously displayed on the occasion of the great riot of the factions
of the Hippodrome—the Greens and the Blues—in 532 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>
These factions had been organized in Constantinople in imitation of
the circus factions of Rome, but had acquired a different character
and a greater importance in the new capital. The two factions
divided between them the entire urban population, and had their
regularly appointed leaders, who enjoyed a recognized place in the
administrative organization of the city. These parties may be regarded
as the last survival of the Hellenic popular assembly of the
city-state, and owing to the extreme centralization of the administration
at Constantinople, they were able to exercise considerable pressure
upon the government.
</p>

<p>
The emperor and the court regularly supported one or other of
the parties. Anastasius had favored the Greens, but Justinian was
a partizan of the Blues. The rivalry of the factions was intense,
and culminated, in the early years of Justinian’s reign, in open warfare,
which gave the lower elements the opportunity for the perpetration
of crimes of all sorts. The punishment of notorious criminals
of both factions in 532 led to their uniting in a revolt which nearly
<pb n="382"/><anchor id="Pg382"/>cost the emperor his throne. At first the mob demanded the release
of their partizans, and the dismissal of John, the praetorian prefect,
whose financial policy was extremely oppressive, of Trebonian, the
able but unscrupulous quaestor, and of the prefect of the city. Later,
emboldened by their success, they crowned as emperor Hypatius, a
nephew of Anastasius. The situation became extremely critical, for,
with the exception of the palace, the whole city fell into the hands
of the rebels, whose battle cry was <q>Nika</q> or <q>Conquer.</q> Justinian
and his councillors had already resolved upon flight, when Theodora,
by a spirited speech in which she declared that she would die before
abandoning the capital, reanimated their hearts and induced them
to alter their decision. By a judicious use of bribes they induced
the Blues to desert the Greens, and the imperial troops exacted a
bloody vengeance from the rebellious populace. For the future the
population of the capital was politically a negligible quantity.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The codification of the Roman law.</hi> One of the greatest monuments
to the reign of Justinian is the <hi rend="italic">corpus iuris civilis</hi>, a codification
of the Roman law by a commission of expert jurists, headed by
Trebonian. The object of this codification was the collection in a
convenient form of all the sources of law then in force, and the
settlement of controversies in the interpretative juristic literature.
The compilation was divided into three parts; the <hi rend="italic">Code of Justinian</hi>,
the <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pandects</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Institutes</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Code</hi> was a collection
of all imperial constitutions of general validity; it was first published
in 529, but a revised edition was issued in 534. The <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi>,
which was issued in 533, consisted of abstracts from the writings of
the most famous Roman jurists systematically arranged so as to
present the whole civil law in so far as it was not contained in the
<hi rend="italic">Code</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Institutes</hi> was a brief manual designed as a text-book
for the use of students of the law. From the time of their promulgation
these compilations constituted the sole law of the empire and
alone carried validity in the courts and formed the only material
for instruction in the law schools of recognized status—those at
Rome, Constantinople and Berytus. Provision was made for the
publication of future legislation in a fourth compilation—the <hi rend="italic">Novels</hi>
or <hi rend="italic">New Constitutions</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">St. Sophia.</hi> Justinian’s administration was characterized by great
building activity. He was zealous in the construction of frontier
defences, the rebuilding of ruined cities, the founding of new ones,
<pb n="383"/><anchor id="Pg383"/>and the erection of religious edifices. Among the latter the most
famous was the great church of the Holy Wisdom (St. Sophia),
which took the place of an older building destroyed in the Nika riot.
Transformed into a Mohammedan mosque, it remains to the present
day as the greatest architectural monument of the eastern Roman
empire. The execution of grandiose works of this sort augmented
the heavy expenditures necessitated by Justinian’s foreign policy,
and required the continual wringing of fresh contributions from the
already overburdened taxpayers. In raising the revenues needed to
meet the demands upon the fiscus, the emperor found the prefect John
an invaluable agent.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Justinian’s religious policy.</hi> Throughout the whole of his reign
Justinian strove with unflagging zeal to secure a united Christian
church within the empire. To this end he did not hesitate to make
use of the autocratic power which he claimed in religious as well as
secular affairs and which was formally admitted by the synod of 536,
which declared that <q>Nothing whatsoever may occur in the church
contrary to the wishes and orders of the emperor.</q> His own views
Justinian set forth in extensive writings on dogmatic questions. The
reconciliation with Rome in 519, so necessary for the recovery of
the West, had alienated the Monophysites, who were predominant
in Egypt, Syria and Mesopotamia, especially among the lower classes
of society. For the rest of his reign Justinian strove indefatigably
to heal this breach, a policy in which he was largely influenced by
Theodora, who was personally sympathetic with the Monophysites
and saw the danger to the empire in the continued hostility of the
eastern peoples. An ecumenical council summoned by him at Constantinople
in 553 accepted a formula of belief upon which he hoped
both orthodox and monophysites could unite. The Pope Vergilius was
forced to submit to Justinian’s will, but the clergy of Italy and Africa
regarded the new doctrine as heretical, and some openly condemned it.
Nor was the desired end attained, for the Monophysites still refused
to be conciliated. A final edict, issued in 565, went still further in
its recognition of the tenets of this sect, but the emperor’s death forestalled
its enforcement and saved the orthodox clergy from the alternative
of submission or persecution.
</p>

<p>
A far harsher treatment was meted out to the Arians, who were
treated as hereticals and punished as criminals. A rebellion of the
Samaritans, occasioned by their persecution, was stamped out in blood.
<pb n="384"/><anchor id="Pg384"/>A determined effort was made to eradicate the last remains of the old
Hellenic faith which still claimed many adherents of note. In 529
the endowment of Plato’s Academy was confiscated and the teaching
of philosophy forbidden at Athens. The persecution of heretics and
unbelievers was accompanied by a vigorous missionary movement
which carried the Christian gospel to the peoples of southern Russia,
the Caucasus, Arabia, the Soudan and the oases of the Sahara.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The <anchor id="corr384"/><corr sic="Condition">condition</corr> of the empire at the death of Justinian.</hi> Justinian
died on 14 November, 565 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> He left the empire completely
exhausted by the conquest of the western provinces. The national
antagonism between Greeks and Romans which was coming more
and more clearly to light was not effectively bridged by a formal
church union, and a mistaken religious policy had fostered the growth
of national ambitions among the native populations of Syria and
Egypt and led to further disunion with the empire. Under Justinian
the annual consulship, for a thousand years identified with the life
of the Roman state, was abolished (540 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). In the government
of the provinces Justinian took the initial steps towards abandoning
the principle of the division of civil and military authority, which
was so marked a feature of Diocletian’s organization, and thus prepared
the way for the later form of the <hi rend="italic">themes</hi>, or military districts, in
which the military commanders were at the head of the civil government
as well. It was in his reign also that the culture of the silkworm
was introduced into the empire by Persian monks, who had
lived in China, learned the jealously guarded secrets of this art, and
brought some eggs of the silkworm out of the country concealed in
hollow canes. The manufacture of silk goods had long been a flourishing
industry in certain cities of the Greek East and was made an
imperial monopoly by Justinian. The introduction of the silkworm
rendered this trade to a large degree independent of the importation
of raw silk from the Orient.
</p>

<p>
As Justinian was the last emperor whose native tongue was Latin,
so he was the last who maintained that language as the language of
government at Constantinople and upheld the traditions of the Roman
imperial policy.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">I. The End of Paganism</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The paganism of the late empire.</hi> In spite of the tremendous
impulse given to the spread of Christianity by Constantine’s policy
of toleration and by its adoption as the religion of the imperial house,
the extinction of paganism was by no means rapid. While the chief
pagan religions during the fourth century were the Oriental cults and
the Orphic mysteries of Eleusis, which strongly resembled them in
character, the worship of the Graeco-Roman Olympic divinities still
attracted numerous followers. But, although paganism persisted in
many and divers forms, these, by a process of religious syncretism,
had come to find their place in a common theological system. This
development had its basis in the common characteristics of the Oriental
cults, each of which inculcated the belief in a supreme deity, and
received its stimulus through the conscious opposition of all forms
of paganism to Christianity, which they had come to recognize as
their common, implacable foe. The chief characteristic of later paganism
was its tendency to monotheism—a belief in one abstract
divinity of whom the various gods were but so many separate manifestations.
The development of a harmonious system of pagan theology
was greatly aided by Neoplatonic philosophy, which may be
regarded as the ultimate expression of ancient paganism. Neoplatonism
was essentially a pantheism, in which all forms of life were
regarded as emanations of the divine mind. But Neoplatonism was
more than a philosophical system; it was a religion, and, like the
Oriental cults, preached a doctrine of salvation for the souls of men.
Such was the paganism by which the Christians of the late empire
were confronted, and which, because of its many points of resemblance
to their own beliefs and practices, they admitted to be a dangerous
rival. At the same time, this similarity made the task of conversion
less difficult.
</p>

<pb n="386"/><anchor id="Pg386"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Causes of the persistence of paganism.</hi> There were several reasons
for the persistence of paganism. The Oriental and Orphic cults
exercised a powerful hold over their votaries, and made an appeal
very similar to that of Christianity. Stoicism, with its high ideal of
conduct, remained a strong tradition among the upper classes of
society; and Neoplatonism had a special attraction for men of intelligence
and culture. Roman patriotism, too, fostered loyalty to the
gods under whose aegis Rome had grown great, and until the close
of the fourth century the Roman Senate was an indefatigable champion
of the ancient faith. But more potent than all these causes was
the fact that, apart from some works of a theological character, the
whole literature of the day was pagan in origin and in spirit. This
was the only material available for instruction in the schools, and
formed the basis of the rhetorical studies which constituted the higher
education of the time. Thus, throughout the whole period of their
intellectual training, the minds of the young were subjected to pagan
influences.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The persecution of paganism.</hi> Constantine the Great adhered
strictly to his policy of religious toleration and, although an active
supporter of Christianity, took no measures against the pagan cults
except to forbid the private sacrifices and practice of certain types of
magical rites. He held the title of pontifex maximus and consequently
was at the head of the official pagan worship. With his
sons, Constantius and Constans, the Christian persecution of the
pagan began. In 341 they prohibited public performance of pagan
sacrifices, and they permitted the confiscation of temples and their
conversion into Christian places of worship. With the accession of
Julian this persecution came to an end, and there was in the main
a return to the policy of religious toleration, although Christians were
prohibited from interpreting classical literature in the schools. The
attempt of Julian to create a universal pagan church proved abortive
and his scheme did not survive his death. His successors, Jovian,
Valentinian I and Valens, adhered to the policy of Constantine the
Great.
</p>

<p>
Gratian was the first emperor to refuse the title of pontifex maximus,
and to deprive paganism of its status as an official religion of
Rome. In 382 he withdrew the state support of the priesthoods of
Rome, and removed from the Senate house the altar and statue of
Victory, which Julian had restored after its temporary removal by
<pb n="387"/><anchor id="Pg387"/>Constantius. This altar was for many of the senators the symbol of
the life of the state itself, and their spokesman Symmachus made an
eloquent plea for its restoration. However, owing to the influence of
Ambrose, the bishop of Milan, the emperor remained obdurate, and
a second appeal to Valentinian II was equally in vain. Although
the brief reign of Eugenius produced a pagan revival in Rome, the
cause of paganism was lost forever in the imperial city. In the
fifth century the Senate of Rome was thoroughly Christian.

Theodosius the Great was even more energetic than his colleague
Gratian in the suppression of paganism. In 380 he issued an edict
requiring all his subjects to embrace <anchor id="corr387"/><corr sic="Chistianity">Christianity</corr>. In 391 he ordered
the destruction of the great temple of Serapis at Alexandria, an event
which sounded the death knell of the pagan cause in the East. The
following year Theodosius absolutely forbade the practice of heathen
worship under the penalties for treason and sacrilege. Theodosius II
continued the vigorous persecution of the heathen. Adherence to
pagan beliefs constituted a crime, and in the Theodosian Code of 438
the laws against pagans find their place among the laws regulating
civic life. It was during the reign of Theodosius II, in 415, that the
pagan philosopher and mathematician, Hypatia, fell a victim to the
fanaticism of the Christian mob of Alexandria.
</p>

<p>
Still, many persons of prominence continued to be secret devotees
of pagan beliefs, and pagan philosophy was openly taught at Athens
until the closing of the schools by Justinian. The acceptance of
Christianity was more rapid in the cities than in the rural districts.
This gave rise to the use of the term pagan (from the Latin <hi rend="italic">paganus</hi>,
<q>rural</q>) to designate non-Christian; a usage which became official
about 370. And it was among the rural population that pagan beliefs
and practices persisted longest. However, between the fifth and the
ninth centuries paganism practically disappeared within the lands
of the empire.
</p>

<p>
The long association with paganism and the rapid incorporation
of large numbers of new converts into the ranks of the church were
not without influence upon the character of Christianity itself. The
ancient belief in magic contributed largely to the spread of the belief
in miracles, and the development of the cult of the saints was stimulated
by the pagan conception of inferior divinities, demigods, and
daemons, while many pagan festivals were Christianized and made
festivals of the church.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The emperor and the church.</hi> The religious policy of Constantine
the Great had the effect of making Christianity a religion of
state and incorporating the Christian church in the state organism.
Thereby the clergy gained the support of the imperial authority in
spreading the belief of the church and in enforcing its ordinances
throughout the empire. Yet this support was won at the price of
the recognition of the autocratic power of the emperor over the church
as well as in the political sphere. Subsequently, however, this recognition
was only accorded to orthodox emperors; that is those who
supported the traditional doctrine of the church as sanctioned in its
general councils.
</p>

<p>
Constantine made use of his supremacy over the church to enforce
unity within its ranks. However, he did not champion any particular
creed but limited his interference to carrying into effect the decisions
of the church councils or synods which he summoned to pass judgment
upon questions which threatened the unity of the church and
the peace of the state.
</p>

<p>
These councils were a development from the provincial synods,
which had previously met to decide church matters of local importance.
Procedure in the councils was modelled upon that of the
Roman Senate; the meetings were conducted by imperial legates,
their decisions were issued in the form of imperial edicts, and it was
to the emperor that appeals from these decrees were made. The first
of the great councils was the Synod of Arles, a council of the bishops
of the western church, summoned by Constantine in 314 to settle the
Donatist schism in the church in Africa. This was followed in 325
by the first universal or ecumenical council of the whole Christian
church which met at Nicaea to decide upon the orthodoxy of the
teachings of Arius of Alexandria.
</p>

<p>
Constantine’s successors followed his example of summoning church
councils to settle sectarian controversies, though, unlike him, many
of them sought to force upon the church the doctrines of their particular
sect. As the general councils accentuated rather than allayed
antagonisms, the eastern emperor Zeno substituted a referendum of
the bishops by provinces. But this precedent was not followed.
Justinian was the emperor who asserted most effectively his authority
<pb n="389"/><anchor id="Pg389"/>over the church. He issued edicts upon purely theological questions
and upon matters of church discipline without reference to church
councils, and he received from the populace of Constantinople the
salutation of <q>High Priest and King.</q><note place="foot"><foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἀρχίερευς βασιλεύς</foreign>. The title Basileus (King) was in common use in the eastern
    part of the empire from the fourth century, but was not assumed officially by the emperors
    till 629 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi></note> The decision of the council
of 553 provoked an attack upon the sacerdotal power of the emperor
by Facundus, bishop of Hermiana in Africa, who declared that not
the emperor but the priests should rule the church. Nevertheless,
this opposition had no immediate effect, and Justinian remained the
successful embodiment <anchor id="corr389"/><corr sic="(missing)">of</corr> <q>Caesaro-papism.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The growth of the papacy.</hi> The late empire witnessed a rapid
extension of the authority of the bishopric of Rome, which had even
previously laid claim to the primacy among the episcopal sees. In
the West the title <q>pope</q> (from the Greek <hi rend="italic">pappas</hi>, <q>father</q>) became
the exclusive prerogative of the bishop of Rome. The papacy was the
sole western patriarchate, or bishopric, with jurisdiction over the metropolitan
and provincial bishops, and was the sole representative of
the western church in its dealings with the bishops of the East. At
the council of Serdica (343 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>) it was decided that bishops deposed
as a result of the Arian controversy might refer their cases to the
Pope Julius for final decision, and, in the course of the fifth century,
eastern bishops frequently appealed to the decision of the pope on
questions of orthodoxy. However, the eastern church never fully
admitted the religious jurisdiction of the papacy. The ideal of the
papacy became the organization of the church on the model of the
empire, with the pope as its religious head.
</p>

<p>
The claims of the papacy were pushed with vigor by Innocent I
(402–417 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>) and Leo I (440–461 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>). The latter laid particular
stress upon the primacy of Peter among the Apostles and
taught that this had descended to his apostolic successors. It was
Leo also who induced the western emperor Valentinian III in 455
to order the whole western church to obey the bishop of Rome as the
heir to the primacy of Peter. The Pope Gelasius (492–496 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>)
asserted the power of the priests to be superior to the imperial authority,
but the establishment of the Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy and
the reconquest of the peninsula by the eastern emperor weakened the
independence of the Roman bishopric. Justinian was able to compel
the popes to submit to his authority in religious matters.
</p>

<pb n="390"/><anchor id="Pg390"/>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The patriarchate of Constantinople.</hi> A rival to the papacy developed
in the patriarchate of Constantinople, which at the Council
of Constantinople in 381 was recognized as taking precedence over
the other eastern bishoprics and ranking next to that of Rome, <q>because
Constantinople is New Rome.</q> However, the primacy of the
bishop of Constantinople in the eastern church was challenged by the
older patriarchates of Ephesus, Antioch and Alexandria, all of which
had been apostolic foundations, while the claims of Constantinople
to that honor were more than dubious. Between 381 and 451 the
bishops of Alexandria successfully disputed the doctrinal authority
of the see of Constantinople, but at the council of Chalcedon (451
<hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>) Pulcheria and Marcian reasserted the primacy of the patriarch
of the capital. At this time also the bishopric of Jerusalem was
recognized as a patriarchate. The patriarch of Constantinople was
now placed on an equality with the pope, a recognition against which
the Pope Leo protested in vain. However, the patriarchs of Constantinople
never acquired the power and independence of the popes.
Situated as they were in the shadow of the imperial palace, and
owing their ecclesiastical authority to the support of the throne, they
rarely ventured to oppose the will of the emperor. Under Justinian
the patriarch held the position of a <q>minister of state in the department
of religion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The temporal power of the clergy.</hi> When Christianity became
a religion of state it was inevitable that the Christian clergy should
occupy a privileged position. This recognition was accorded them
by Constantine the Great when he exempted them from personal
services (<hi rend="italic">munera</hi>) in 313 and taxation in 319 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Those who
entered the ranks of the clergy were expected to abandon all worldly
pursuits, and an imperial edict of 452 excluded them from all gainful
occupations. In addition to their ecclesiastical authority in matters
of belief and church discipline, the bishops also acquired considerable
power in secular affairs. In the days of persecution the Christians
had regularly submitted legal differences among themselves to the
arbitration of their bishops, rather than resort to the tribunals of
state. Constantine the Great gave legal sanction to this episcopal
arbitration in civil cases; Arcadius, however, restricted its use to
cases in which the litigants voluntarily submitted to the bishop’s
judgment. The bishops enjoyed no direct criminal jurisdiction,
al<pb n="391"/><anchor id="Pg391"/>though since the right of sanctuary was accorded to the churches,
they were frequently able to intercede with effect for those who sought
asylum with them. In the enforcement of moral and humanitarian
legislation the state called for the coöperation of the bishops.
</p>

<p>
The influential position of the bishops as the religious heads of the
municipalities led to their being accorded a definite place in the
municipal administration. In protecting the impoverished taxpayers
against the imperial officers they were more effective than the <q><hi rend="italic">defensores
plebis</hi>.</q> And in the days of the barbarian invasions, when
the representatives of the imperial authority were driven from the
provinces, the bishops became the leaders of the Roman population
in their contact with the barbarian conquerors.

    <index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="III. Sectarian Strife"/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. Sectarian Strife</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Sectarianism.</hi> The history of the church from Constantine to
Justinian is largely the history of sectarian strife, which had its origin
in doctrinal controversies. While the western church in general abstained
from acute theological discussions and adhered strictly to the
orthodox or established creed, devoting its energies to the development
of church organization, the church of the East, imbued with
the Greek philosophic spirit, busied itself with attempts to solve the
mysteries of the Christian faith and was a fruitful source of heterodoxy.
Strife between the adherents of the various sects was waged
with extreme bitterness and frequently culminated in riots and bloodshed.
Toleration was unknown and heretics, like pagans, were
classed as criminals and excluded from communion with the orthodox
church. Of the many sects which arose in the fourth and fifth centuries,
two were of outstanding importance. These were the Arians
and the monophysites.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Arianism.</hi> Arianism had its rise in an attempt to express with
philosophical precision the relation of the three members of the Holy
Trinity; God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. About 318 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>,
Arius, a presbyter of Alexandria, taught that God was from eternity
but that the Son and the Spirit were his creations. Over the teaching
of Arius, a controversy arose which threatened the unity of the
church. Accordingly, Constantine intervened and summoned the
ecumenical council of Nicaea to decide upon the orthodoxy of Arius.
<pb n="392"/><anchor id="Pg392"/>The council accepted the formula of Athanasius that the Son was
of the same substance (<hi rend="italic">homo-ousion</hi>) as the Father, which was the
doctrine of the West. Arius was exiled.
</p>

<p>
The struggle, however, was by no means over, for the Nicene
creed found many opponents among the eastern bishops who did not
wish to exclude the Arians from the church. The leader of this
party was Eusebius of Caesarea. In 335 they brought about the
deposition of Athanasius, who had been bishop of Alexandria since
328. After the death of Constantine, Athanasius was permitted to
return to his see, only to be expelled again in 339 by Constantius,
who was under the influence of Eusebius. He took refuge in the
West, where the Pope Julius gave him his support. At a general
council of the church held at Serdica (Sofia) in 343 there was a sharp
division between East and West, but the supporters of Athanasius
were in the majority, and he and the other orthodox eastern bishops
were reinstated in their sees (345 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>).
</p>

<p>
When Constantius became sole ruler of the empire (353 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>)
the enemies of Athanasius once more gained the upper hand. The
emperor forced a general council convoked at Milan in 353 to condemn
and depose Athanasius, while the Pope Liberius, who supported
him, was exiled to Macedonia. A new council held at Sirmium in
357 tried to secure religious peace by forbidding the use of the word
<q>substance</q> in defining the relation of the Father and the Son, and
sanctioned only the term <hi rend="italic">homoios</hi> (like). The adherents of this
creed were called Homoeans. Although they were not Arians, their
solution was rejected by the conservatives in both East and West.
In 359 a double council was held, the western bishops meeting at
Ariminum, the eastern at Seleucia. The result was the acceptance
of the Sirmian creed, although the western council had to be almost
starved before it yielded. Under Julian and Jovian the Arians enjoyed
full toleration, and while Valentinian I pursued a similar policy,
Valens went further and gave Arianism his support.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, however, the labors of the three great Cappadocians,—Basil
of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus and Gregory of
Nyssa—had already done much to reconcile the eastern bishops to
the Nicaean confession and, with the accession of <anchor id="corr392"/><corr sic="Theododius">Theodosius</corr> I, the
fate of Arianism was sealed. A council of the eastern church met
at Constantinople in 381 and accepted the Nicene creed. The Arian
bishops were deposed and assemblies of the heretics forbidden by
im<pb n="393"/><anchor id="Pg393"/>perial edicts. Among the subjects of the empire Arianism rapidly
died out, although it existed for a century and a half as the faith
of several Germanic peoples.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The monophysite controversy.</hi> While the point at issue in the
dogmatic controversies of the fourth century was the relation of God
to the Son and the Holy Spirit, the burning question of the fifth
and sixth centuries was the nature of Christ. And, like the former,
the latter dispute arose in the East, having its origin in the divergent
views of the theological schools of Antioch and Alexandria. The former
laid stress upon the two natures in Christ—the divine and the
human; the latter emphasized his divinity to the exclusion of his
humanity, and hence its adherents received the name of monophysites.
The Antiochene position was the orthodox or traditional view of the
church, and was held universally in the West, where the duality of
Christ was accepted without any attempt to determine the relationship
of his divine and human qualities. Beneath the doctrinal controversy
lay the rivalry between the patriarchates of Alexandria and
Constantinople, and the awakening national antagonism of the native
Egyptian and Syrian peoples towards the Greeks. The conflict began
in 429 with an attack of Cyril, patriarch of Alexandria, upon the
teachings of Nestorius, the patriarch of Constantinople. Cyril, taking
the view that the nature of Christ was human made fully divine,
justified the use of the word <hi rend="italic">Theotokos</hi> (Mother of God), which was
coming to be applied generally to the Virgin Mary. Nestorius criticized
its use, and argued in favor of the term Mother of Christ. In
the controversy which ensued, Cyril won the support of the bishop of
Rome, who desired to weaken the authority of the see of Constantinople,
and Nestorius was condemned at the council of Ephesus
in 431.
</p>

<p>
The next phase of the struggle opened in 448, when Dioscorus,
the occupant of the Alexandrine see, assailed Flavian, the patriarch
of the capital, for having deposed Eutyches, a monophysite abbot of
Constantinople. At the so-called <q>Robber Council</q> of Ephesus
(449 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>) Dioscorus succeeded in having Flavian deprived of his
see. But the pope, Leo I. pronounced in favor of the doctrine of
the duality of Christ, and in 451 the new emperor Marcian called
an ecumenical council at Chalcedon which definitely reasserted the
primacy of the see of Constantinople in the East, approved the use of
<hi rend="italic">Theotokos</hi>, and declared that Christ is of two natures. The attempt
<pb n="394"/><anchor id="Pg394"/>to enforce the decisions of this council provoked disturbances in Egypt,
Palestine and the more easterly countries. In Palestine it required
the use of armed force to suppress a usurping monophysite bishop.
In Egypt the enforcement led to a split between the orthodox Greek
and the monophysite Coptic churches.
</p>

<p>
As the opposition to the decree of Chalcedon still disturbed the
peace of the church, the emperor Zeno in 482, at the instigation of
the patriarchs Acacius of Constantinople and Peter of Alexandria,
sought to settle the dispute by exercise of the imperial authority. He
issued a letter to the church of Egypt called the <hi rend="italic">Henoticon</hi>, which,
while acknowledging the councils of Nicaea and Constantinople, condemned
that of Chalcedon, and declared that <q>Christ is one and
not two.</q> This doctrine was at once condemned by the Pope Silvanus.
The rupture with Rome lasted until 519, when a reconciliation
was effected at the price of complete submission by the East
and the rehabilitation of the council of Chalcedon. This in turn
antagonized the monophysites of Syria and Egypt and caused Justinian
to embark upon his hopeless task of reëstablishing complete religious
unity within the empire by holding the western and winning
back the eastern church.
</p>

<p>
Justinian hoped to reconcile the monophysites by an interpretation
of the discussions of the council of Chalcedon which would be acceptable
to them. This led him, in 544, to condemn the so-called
Three Chapters, which were the doctrines of the opponents of the
monophysites. And although this step implied a condemnation of
the council of Chalcedon itself, and was consequently opposed in the
West, he forced the fifth ecumenical council of Constantinople in 553
to sanction it. However, neither this concession nor the still greater
one of the edict of 565 availed to win back the extreme monophysites
of Egypt and Syria, where opposition to the religious jurisdiction of
Constantinople had taken a national form, and the religious disunion
in the East continued until these lands were lost to the empire.

    <index index="toc"/><index index="pdf" level1="IV. Monasticism"/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">IV. Monasticism</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">The origin of monasticism.</hi> Monasticism (from the Greek
<hi rend="italic">monos</hi>, <q>single</q>), which became so marked a feature of the religious
life of the Middle Ages, had its origin in the ascetic tendencies of the
early Christian church, which harmonized with the eastern religious
<pb n="395"/><anchor id="Pg395"/>and philosophic ideal of a life of pure contemplation. The chief
characteristics of early Christian asceticism were celibacy, fasting,
prayer, surrender of worldly goods, and the adoption of a hermit’s
life. This renouncement of a worldly life was practised by large
numbers of both men and women, especially in Egypt. It was there
that organized monastic life began early in the fourth century under
the influence of St. Anthony in northern and Pachomius in southern
Egypt.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Anthony and Pachomius in Egypt.</hi> Anthony was the founder
of a monastic colony, which was a direct development from the eremitical
life. He laid down no rule for the guidance of the lives of the
monks, but permitted the maximum of individual freedom. It was
Pachomius who first established a truly cenobitical monastery, in
which the monks lived a common life under the direction of a single
head, the abbot, according to a prescribed rule with fixed religious
exercises and daily labor. The organization of convents for women
accompanied the foundation of the monasteries. However, the Antonian
type of monkhood continued to be the more popular in Egypt,
where monasticism flourished throughout the fourth, but began to
decline in the fifth, century.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Eastern monasticism.</hi> From Egypt the movement spread to
Palestine, but in Syria and Mesopotamia there was an independent
development from the local eremitical ideals. Characteristic of Syrian
asceticism were the pillar hermits who passed their lives upon the
top of lofty pillars. The founder of the Greek monasticism was
Basil (c. 360 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), who copied Pachomius in organizing a fully
cenobitical life. He discouraged excessive asceticism and emphasized
the value of useful toil. The eastern monks were noted for their
fanaticism and they took a very prominent part in the religious disorders
of the time. The abuses of the early, unregulated monastic
life led to the formulation of monastic rules and the subjection of the
monks to the authority of the bishops.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Monasticism in the west: Benedict.</hi> Monasticism was introduced
in the West by Athanasius, who came from Egypt to Rome
in 339. From Italy it spread to the rest of western Europe. The
great organizer of western monasticism was Benedict, who lived in
the early sixth century, and founded the monastery at Monte Cassino
about 520 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> His monastic rule definitely abandoned the eremitical
ideal in favor of the cenobitical. In addition to worship and
<pb n="396"/><anchor id="Pg396"/>work, the Benedictine rule made reading a monastic duty. This
stimulated the collection of libraries in the monasteries and made the
monks the guardians of literary culture throughout the Middle Ages.
</p>

<p>
As yet no distinct monastic orders had developed, but each monastery
was autonomous under the direction of its own abbot.
</p>
</div><div>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">V. Literature and Art</hi></head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">General characteristics.</hi> The period between the accession of
Diocletian and the death of Justinian saw the gradual disappearance
of the ancient Graeco-Roman culture. In spite of Diocletian’s reëstablishment
of the empire, there was a steady lowering of the general
cultural level. This was due chiefly to the progressive barbarization
of the empire and to the decline of paganism which lay at the roots
of ancient civilization. The one creative force of the time was Christianity,
but, save in the fields of religion and ethics, it did little to
stem the ebbing tide of old world culture.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Literature.</hi> The dying out of this culture is clearly to be seen
in the history of the Greek and Roman literatures of the period,
each of which shows the same general traits. In the fourth century,
under the impulse of the restoration of Diocletian, there is a brief
revival of productivity in pagan literature. But this is characterized
by archaism and lack of creative power. The imitation of the past
produces not only an artificiality of style, but also of language, so
that literature loses touch with contemporary life and the language
of the literary world is that of previous centuries, no longer that
of the people. Rhetorical studies are the sole form of higher education,
and are in part responsible for the archaism and artificiality
of contemporary literature, owing to the emphasis which they laid
upon literary form to the neglect of substance. In the fifth century,
following the complete triumph of Christianity, pagan literature comes
to an end.
</p>

<p>
The recognition of Christianity as an imperial religion by Constantine,
its subsequent victorious assault upon paganism, and the intensity
of sectarian strife gave to Christian literature a freshness and
vigor lacking in the works of pagan writers, and produced a wealth
of apologetic, dogmatic and theological writings. But the Christian
authors followed the accepted categories of the pagan literature, and
while producing polemic writings, works of translation and of religious
<pb n="397"/><anchor id="Pg397"/>exegesis, they entered the fields of history, biography, oratory and
epistolography. Thus arose a profane, as well as a sacred, Christian
literature. And since Christian writers were themselves men of education
and appealed to educated circles, their works are dominated
by the current rhetorical standards of literary taste. Yet in some
aspects, in particular in sacred poetry and popular religious biography,
they break away from classical traditions and develop new
literary types.
</p>

<p>
But after the first half of the fifth century originality and productivity
in Christian literature also are on the wane. This is in
part due to the effects of the struggle of the empire with barbarian
peoples; in part to the suppression of freedom of religious thought by
the orthodox church. Even after the extinction of paganism the
classical literatures of Greece and Rome afforded the only material
for a non-religious education. And since they no longer constituted
a menace to Christianity, the church became reconciled to their use
for purposes of instruction, and it was to the church, and especially
to the monasteries, that the pagan literature owes its preservation
throughout the Dark Ages.
</p>

<p>
A symptom of the general intellectual decline of the later empire
is the dying out of Greek in the western empire. While up to the
middle of the third Christian century the world of letters had been
bi-lingual, from that time onwards, largely as a result of the political
conditions which led to a separation of the eastern and western parts
of the empire, the knowledge of Greek began to disappear in the
West until in the late empire it was the exception for a Latin-speaking
man of letters to be versed in the Greek tongue.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Pagan Latin literature.</hi> A wide gulf separated the pagan Latin
literature of the fourth century from that of the early principate.
Poetry had degenerated to learned tricks, historical writing had taken
the form of epitomies, while published speeches and letters were but
empty exhibitions of rhetorical skill. The influence of rhetorical
studies made itself felt in legal phraseology, which now lost its former
clarity, directness and simplicity. Still there are a few outstanding
literary figures who deserve mention because they are so expressive
of the tendencies of the time or because they have been able to attain
a higher level.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Ausonius and Symmachus (c. 345–405 A. D.).</hi> The career of
Ausonius, a professor of grammar and rhetoric at Bordeaux, whose
<pb n="398"/><anchor id="Pg398"/>life covers the fourth century, shows how highly rhetorical instruction
was valued. His ability procured him imperial recognition,
and he became the tutor of Gratian, from whom he received the honor
of the consulate in 379. His poetical works are chiefly clever verbal
plays, but one, the <hi rend="italic">Mosella</hi>, which describes a voyage down the river
Moselle, is noteworthy for its description of contemporary life and
its appreciation of the beauty of nature. Quintus Aurelius Symmachus,
city prefect, and the leader of the pagan party in Rome
under Gratian and Valentinian II, is a typical representative of the
educated society of the time which strove to keep alive a knowledge
of classical literature. He left a collection of orations and letters,
poor in thought, but rich in empty phrase.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Ammianus Marcellinus, fl. 350–400 A. D.</hi> A man of far different
stamp was Ammianus Marcellinus, by birth a Greek of Antioch,
and an officer of high rank in the imperial army. Taking Tacitus
as his model, he wrote in Latin a history which continued the former’s
work for the period from 96 to 378 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Of this only the part covering
the years 353 to 378 has survived. His history is characterized
by sound judgment and objectivity, but is marred by the introduction
of frequent digressions extraneous to the subject in hand and
by a strained rhetorical style. However, it remains the one considerable
pagan work in Latin prose from the late empire.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Claudius Claudianus and Rutilius Namatianus (both fl. 400
A. D.).</hi> The <q>last eminent man of letters who was a professed
pagan</q> in the western empire was Claudius Claudianus. Claudian
was by birth an Egyptian Greek who took up his residence in Rome
about 395 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> and attached himself to the military dictator, Stilicho.
He chose to write in Latin, and composed hexameter epics which
celebrated the military exploits of his patron. He also wrote mythological
epics and elegiacs. Claudian found his inspiration in Ovid
and reawakened the charm of Augustan poetry. A contemporary of
Claudian, and, like him a pagan, was Rutilius Namatianus, who
was a native of southern Gaul but a resident of Rome where he attained
the highest senatorial offices. His literary fame rests upon the
elegiac poem in which he described his journey from Rome to Gaul in
416 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, and revealed the hold which the imperial city still continued
to exercise upon men’s minds.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Christian Latin literature: Lactantius (d. about 325 A. D.).</hi>
It is among the writers of Christian literature that the few great
<pb n="399"/><anchor id="Pg399"/>Latin authors of the time are to be found. At the beginning of the
fourth century stood Lactantius, an African, who became a teacher
of rhetoric in Nicomedia, where he was converted to Christianity.
His chief work was the <hi rend="italic">Divinae Institutiones</hi>, an introduction to
Christian doctrine, which was an attempt to create a philosophical
Christianity. His purity of style has caused him to be called the
<q>Christian Cicero.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Ambrose, (d. 397 A. D.).</hi> Ambrose, the powerful bishop of Milan,
who exercised such great influence with Gratian and Theodosius the
Great, also displayed great literary activity. In general, his writings
are developments of his sermons, and display no very great
learning. Their power depended upon the strength of his personality.
More important from a literary standpoint are the hymns which he
composed for use in church services to combat in popular form the
Arian doctrines. In his verses Ambrose adhered to the classic metrical
forms, but in the course of the next two centuries these were abandoned
for the use of the rhymed verse, which itself was a development
of the current rhetorical prose.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Jerome, 335–420 A. D.</hi> The most learned of the Latin Christian
writers of antiquity was Jerome (Hieronymus), a native of northern
Bosnia, whose retired, studious life was in striking contrast to the
public, official career of Ambrose. A Greek and Hebrew scholar, in
addition to his dogmatic writings he made a Latin translation of the
Old Testament from the Hebrew (the basis of the later <hi rend="italic">Vulgate</hi>), and
another of the Greek <hi rend="italic">Church History</hi> of Eusebius.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Augustine, 354–430 A. D.</hi> The long line of notable literary figures
of the African church is closed by Augustine, the bishop of Hippo
who died during the siege of his city by the Vandals in 430 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> In
his early life a pagan, he found inspiration and guidance in the
philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. But while Jerome was still dominated
by Greek religious thought, Augustine was the first Latin Christian
writer to emancipate himself from this dependence and display
originality of form and ideas in his works. Of these the two most
significant are the <hi rend="italic">Confessions</hi> and <hi rend="italic">On the City of God</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Confessions</hi>
reveal the story of his inner life, the struggle of good and evil
in his own soul. The work <hi rend="italic">On the City of God</hi> was inspired by the
sack of Rome by Alaric in 410 and the accusation of the pagans that
this was a punishment for the abandonment of the ancient deities.
In answer to this charge Augustine develops a philosophical
inter<pb n="400"/><anchor id="Pg400"/>pretation of history as the conflict of good and evil forces, in which
the Heavenly City is destined to triumph over that of this world.
His work prepared the way for the conception of the Roman Catholic
Church as the city of God.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Boethius (d. 524 A. D.) and Cassiodorus (c. 480–575 A. D.).</hi>
Between the death of Augustine and the death of Justinian the West
produced no ecclesiastical literary figure worthy of note. However,
under the Ostrogothic régime in Italy, profane literature is represented
by two outstanding personalities—Boethius and Cassiodorus.
The patrician Boethius while in prison awaiting his death sentence
from Theoderic composed his work <hi rend="italic">On the Consolation of Philosophy</hi>,
a treatise embued with the finest spirit of Greek intellectual life.
Cassiodorus, who held the posts of quaestor and master of the offices
under Theoderic, has left valuable historical material in his <hi rend="italic">Variae</hi>,
a collection of official letters drawn up by him in the course of his
administrative duties. His chief literary work was a history of the
Goths, of which unfortunately only a few excerpts have remained.
In his later years Cassiodorus retired to a monastery which he founded
and organized according to the Benedictine rule. There he performed
an inestimable service in fostering the preservation of secular as well
as ecclesiastical knowledge among the brethren, thus giving to the
Benedictine monks the impulse to intellectual work for which they
were so distinguished in medieval times.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Greek Christian literature; Religious prose.</hi> It was in the
fourth century that Greek Christian prose literature reached its height.
Among its leading representatives were Athanasius, the bishop of
Alexandria who fought the Arian heresy; Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea,
the founder of church history; Gregory of Nazianzus, church
orator and poet; and Basil, bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, the
organizer of Greek monasticism. Above them all in personality and
literary ability stood John Chrysostom (the Golden-mouth), patriarch
of Constantinople under Arcadius. With the fifth century came a
decline in theological prose; men resorted to excerpts and collections.
But at this time began the development of the popular monastic narratives
and lives of the saints which served as the novels and romances
of the time.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Religious poetry.</hi> It was subsequent to the fourth century also
that Christian religious poetry attained its bloom. Here a break was
made with classical tradition in the adoption of accentual in place of
<pb n="401"/><anchor id="Pg401"/>quantitative verse. This was in harmony with the disappearance of
distinctions of syllabic quantity from popular speech. The use of
rhythm in verse was introduced by Gregory of Nazianzus, but the
chief and most productive representative of the new poetry was Romanus,
a converted Syrian Jew whose activity falls in the reign of
Justinian.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Greek profane literature.</hi> Contemporary profane Greek literature
exhibits less originality and interest. Historical writing was
continued in strict imitation of classical models by both Christian
and pagan writers. Of exceptional historical value are the works of
Procopius, the historian of the wars of Justinian, who like Ammianus
Marcellinus shared in an official capacity in the events which he described.
A more popular form of historical writing was the compilation
of chronicles of world history, collections of excerpts put together
for the most part by men who failed to understand their sources.
The profane verse of the time is represented by narrative poems, such
as the <hi rend="italic">Dionysiaca</hi> and the metrical version of the Gospel of St. John
composed by Nonnus in Egypt (c. 400 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>), and by a rich epigrammatic
literature.
</p>

<p>
In the eastern empire literary productivity continued, although on
the decline, slightly longer than in the West, but by the middle of
the sixth century there also it had come to an end.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">Art.</hi> The art of the late empire exhibits the same general characteristics
as the literature. Not only was there a general lack of
originality and creative capacity, but even the power of imitating the
masterpieces of earlier times was conspicuously lacking. The Arch
of Constantine erected in 312 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> affords a good illustration of the
situation. Its decoration mainly consists of sculptures appropriated
from monuments of the first and second century, beside which the
new work is crude and unskilful. A comparison of the imperial
portraits on the coins of the fourth century with those of the principate
up to the dynasty of the Severi reveals the same decline in taste and
artistic ability.
</p>

<p>
In the realm of art as in literature Christianity supplied a new
creative impulse, which made itself felt in the adaptation of pagan
artistic forms to Christian purposes. The earliest traces of Christian
art are to be found in the mural paintings of the underground
burial vaults and chapels of the Roman catacombs, and in the sculptured
reliefs which adorned the sarcophagi of the wealthy. These
<pb n="402"/><anchor id="Pg402"/>were popular branches of contemporary art and the influence of Christianity
consisted in the artistic <anchor id="corr402"/><corr sic="represenation">representation</corr> of biblical subjects and
the employment of Christian symbolical motives. These forms of
Christian art decayed with the general cultural decline that followed
the third century.
</p>

<p>
The most important and original contribution of Christianity to
the art of the late empire was in the development of church architecture.
To meet the needs of the Christian church service, which
included the opportunity to address large audiences, there arose the
Christian basilica, which took its name from the earlier profane structures
erected to serve as places for the conduct of public business, but
which differed considerably from them in its construction. In general
the basilica was a long rectangular building, divided by rows of
columns into a central hall or nave and two side halls or aisles. The
walls of the nave rose above the roof of the aisles, and allowed space
for windows. The roof was flat or gabled, and, like the wall spaces,
covered with paintings or mosaics. The rear of the structure was a
semicircular apse which held the seats of the bishop and the lower
clergy. To the original plan there came to be added the transept, a
hall at right angles to the main structure between it and the apse.
This gave the basilica its later customary crosslike form.
</p>

<p>
While the basilica became the almost universal form of church
architecture in Italy and the West, in the East preference was shown
for round or polygonal structures with a central dome, an outgrowth
of the Roman rotunda, which was first put to Christian uses in tombs
and grave chapels. A rich variety of types, combining the central
dome with other architectural features arose in the cities of Asia and
Egypt. The masterpiece of this style was the church of St. Sophia
erected by Justinian in Constantinople in 537 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi> Another notable
example from the same period is the church of San Vitale at Ravenna.
</p>

<p>
In the mosaics which adorn these and other structures of the time
are to be seen the traces of a Christian Hellenistic school of painting
which gave pictorial expression to the whole biblical narrative.
These mosaics and the miniature paintings employed in the illuminated
manuscripts survived as prominent features of Byzantine art.

        <head>EPILOGUE</head>
        
        <p>
            <hi rend="bold">The Lombard and Slavic invasions.</hi> In 568 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>, three years
            after the death of Justinian, the Lombards descended upon Italy from
            Pannonia and wrested from the empire the Po valley and part of
            central Italy. The Romans were confined to Ravenna, Rome, and
            the southern part of the peninsula. Towards the close of the sixth
            century (after 581 <hi rend="small">A. D.</hi>) occurred the migrations of the Bulgars and
            Slavs across the Danube which resulted in the Slavic occupation of
            Illyricum and the interposition of a barbarous, heathen people between
            the eastern empire and western Europe. Early in the seventh
            century the Roman possessions in Spain were lost to the Goths.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <hi rend="bold">The papacy and the Holy Roman Empire.</hi> The weakness of
            the imperial authority in the West led to the strengthening of the
            papacy and its acquisition of political power in Italy. It was the
            papacy also which kept alive in western Europe the ideal of a universal
            imperial church, for the whole of western Christendom came
            to acknowledge the supremacy of the Roman see. Nor was the conception
            of a reëstablished western empire lost to view; and it was
            destined to find realization in the Holy Roman empire of Charlemagne
            and his successors. Of great importance for the future development
            of European civilization was the fact that the western part
            of the Roman empire had passed under the control of peoples either
            already Christianized or soon to become so, and that the church,
            chiefly through the monasteries, was thus enabled to become the
            guardian of the remnants of ancient culture.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <hi rend="bold">The Byzantine empire.</hi> The loss of the western provinces and
            Illyricum transferred the center of gravity in the empire from the
            Latin to the Greek element and accelerated the transformation of the
            eastern Roman empire into an essentially Greek state—the Byzantine
            empire. The Byzantine empire inherited from the Roman its
            organization and the name <hi rend="italic">Romaioi</hi> (Romans) for its citizens, but
            before the close of the sixth century Greek had supplanted Latin as
            the language of government. This transformation further accentuated
            the religious differences between East and West, which led ultimately
            to the separation of the Greek and Roman Catholic Churches.

        <p>
            <hi rend="bold">The Mohammedan invasion.</hi> Before the middle of the seventh
            century Egypt and Syria were occupied by the Saracens, whose conquest
            was facilitated by the animosity of the monophysite native populations
            towards the rule of an orthodox emperor. However, the loss
            of these territories gave fresh solidarity to the empire in the East by
            restricting its authority to the religiously and linguistically homogeneous,
            and thoroughly loyal, population of Asia Minor and the eastern
            Balkan peninsula. This solidarity enabled the Byzantine empire
            to fulfill its historic mission of forming the eastern bulwark of Christian
            Europe against the Turk throughout the Middle Ages.
